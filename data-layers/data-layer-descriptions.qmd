## Artisanal fisheries sustainability 
#### [ao_sust](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/ao_sust.csv) {-} 

These data are used to estimate the sustainability of artisanal fishing practices. Artisanal and subsistence fishing scores were calculated from [Sea Around Us](https://www.seaaroundus.org/) catch data [@pauly2020] and the RAM Legacy Database [http://ramlegacy.org/](http://ramlegacy.org/) [@ramlegacystockassessmentdatabase2024]. For this layer, nearly identical methods were used as in the fisheries sub-goal calculations. Instead of producing scores for all global fish stocks, we only produced scores for catch that is denoted as artisanal and subsistence catch in the Sea Around Us catch data.

We used SeaLifeBase [@palomares2022search] and FishBase [@froese2022fishbase] to align taxa names across datasets.

## Average species condition 
#### [spp_status](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/spp_status.csv) {-} 

See Species goal for calculations.

These are the status data for the species subgoal, calculated using the species model. These data describe the average condition of species within each region based on risk status from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ([http://www.iucnredlist.org/](http://www.iucnredlist.org/)) [@iucn2024] and BirdLife International ([http://datazone.birdlife.org](http://datazone.birdlife.org)) [@iucn_spatial_2024; @birdlifeinternationalandhandbookofthebirdsoftheworld2020] data.  

We include only species from comprehensively assessed groups (groups with >90% of species assessed) to help control for sampling bias.  We found that some regions (e.g., Atlantic) had assessments for a much larger proportion of species than other regions, but this problem was less pronounced when we only included comprehensively assessed species.      

These data incorporate regional IUCN assessment information when possible (i.e., when a species' IUCN status varies geographically).

## B/Bmsy estimates 
#### [fis_b_bmsy](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/fis_b_bmsy.csv) {-} 

Status of global fish stocks based on B/Bmsy values (the ratio of population biomass compared to the biomass required to deliver maximum sustainable yield).  We preferentially used B/Bmsy estimates from formal stock assessments from the  
RAM Legacy Database [http://ramlegacy.org/](http://ramlegacy.org/) [@ramlegacystockassessmentdatabase2024]. We assigned the stocks to OHI and FAO regions using Free [-@free2017mapping] spatial data describing the range of each stock. When a stock was missing the most recent years of data, carried over the most recent year after 2010 to estimate the missing years. 


When RAM data were unavailable, we use the data-limited catch-MSY model [@martell2016simple] to estimate B/Bmsy values using yearly fish catch reconstruction data. For the catch-MSY model, we defined a stock as a species caught within an FAO major fishing area (www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en). This definition of a stock eliminated all taxa not identified to species level. This approach assumes that stocks are defined by FAO region, which we know is often not true because multiple stocks of the same species can exist within an FAO region and some stocks cover multiple FAO regions. However, this assumption is necessary without range maps of stocks. The catch data were summed for each species/FAO region/year, and the catch-MSY model was applied to each stock and FAO region to estimate B/Bmsy.

We used SeaLifeBase [@palomares2022search] and FishBase [@froese2022fishbase] to align taxa names across datasets.

## Carbon storage weights 
#### [element_wts_cs_km2_x_storage](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/element_wts_cs_km2_x_storage.csv) {-} 

This layer describes the relative value of the habitats in each region to carbon storage, and is calculated by multiplying the habitat extent (km^2^) in each region by the amount of carbon the habitat sequesters [@chen_tidal_2022]. 

Data is generated in ohi-global/eez/conf/functions.R. 

These data are called internally by ohicore functions (see: conf/config.R to see how these data are specified) to weight the data used to calculate pressure and resilience values.

## Chemical pollution 
#### [po_chemicals](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/po_chemicals.csv) {-} 

*Pressure*

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: pollution*

This pressure layer is calculated using modeled data for land-based organic pollution (pesticide data), land-based inorganic pollution (using impermeable surfaces as a proxy), and ocean pollution (shipping and ports). These global data are provided at ~1km resolution, with raster values scaled from 0-1 (Halpern et al. 2008, 2015). To obtain the final pressure values, the three raster layers were summed (with cell values capped at 1).   

#### Land-based organic pollution
Data were calculated using modeled plumes of land-based pesticide pollution that provide intensity of pollution at 1km^2^ resolution (Halpern et al. 2008). 

Organic pollution was estimated from FAO data on annual country-level pesticide use ([http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E](http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E)) [@united_nations_fao_2016], measured in metric tons of active ingredients.  FAO  uses survey methods to measure quantities of pesticides applied to crops and seeds in the agriculture sector, including insecticides, mineral oils, herbicides, fungicides, seed treatments insecticides, seed treatments fungicides, plant growth regulators and rodenticides. Missing values were estimated by regression between fertilizer and pesticides when possible, and when not possible with agricultural GDP as a proxy.  Data were summed across all pesticide compounds and reported in metric tons. Upon inspection the data included multiple 0 values that are most likely data gaps in the time-series, so they were treated as such and replaced with NA. In addition, regions with only 1 data point and regions where the most recent data point was prior to 2005 were excluded. Uninhabited countries were assumed to have no pesticide use and thus excluded. 

Region-level pollution values were then dasymetrically distributed over a region’s landscape using global landcover data from 2009, derived from the MODIS satellite data at ~500m resolution. These values were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~76,000) were aggregated into ~1km Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster. 

These raw values were then ln(X+1) transformed and normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99.99th quantile of raster values across all years.  The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.  

#### Land-based inorganic pollution
These data are from Halpern et al. (2008, 2015), and available from Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, [https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F19021PC, rescaled_2013_inorganic_mol](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F19021PC, rescaled_2013_inorganic_mol)). Non-point source inorganic pollution was modeled with global 1 km^2^ impervious surface area data [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/) under the assumption that most of this pollution comes from urban runoff. These data will not capture point-sources of pollution or nonpoint sources where paved roads do not exist (e.g., select places in developing countries). Values were aggregated to the watershed and distributed to the pour point (i.e., stream and river mouths) for the watershed with raster statistics (i.e., aggregation by watershed).

#### Ocean pollution (shipping lanes, ports)
These data are from Halpern et al. [-@halpern2015spatial], and available from the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, [https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1DR2SDD](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1DR2SDD), rescaled_2013_one_ocean_pollution_mol). Ocean-based pollution combines commercial shipping traffic data and port data.  

Shipping data was obtained from two sources:  (1) Over the past 20 years, 10-20% of the vessel fleet has voluntarily participated in collecting meteorological data for the open ocean, which includes location at the time of measurement, as part of the Volunteer Observing System (VOS). (2) In order to improve maritime safety, in 2002 the International Maritime Organization SOLAS agreement required all vessels over 300 gross tonnage (GT) and vessels carrying passengers to equip Automatic Identification System (AIS) transceivers, which use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to precisely locate vessels.  

Port data was based on the volume (measured in tonnes) of goods transported through commercial ports as a proxy measure of port traffic. Total cargo volume data by port was collected from regional and national statistical organizations, and from published port rankings.

## Chemical pollution trend 
#### [cw_chemical_trend](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/cw_chemical_trend.csv) {-} 


The inverse of the pressure data (1 - `po_chemicals_3nm`) was used to estimate chemical trends for the clean water goal. The proportional yearly change in chemical pressure values were estimated using a linear regression model of the most recent five years of data (i.e., slope divided by value from the earliest year included in the regression model).  The slope was then multiplied by five to get the predicted change in 5 years.  

The only layer with yearly data was land-based organic pollution (pesticide data). The land-based inorganic pollution (using impermeable surfaces as a proxy) and ocean pollution (shipping and ports) remained the same across years.

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: habitat destruction*

The total tonnes of coral harvest were determined for each region using export data from the FAO Global Commodities database [@un-fao2024]. The tonnes of ornamental fishing was divided by the area of coral, taken from the hab_coral layer, to get the intensity of coral harvest per region. Following this, we set the reference value as the 95th quantile of coral harvest intensity. We then divided the intensity by the reference intensity. Anything that scored above 1 received a intensity pressure score of 1. To incorporate the health of the coral, we then multiplied the intensity pressure score by the health of the coral, to get the final pressure score.

Sector evenness was measured using Shannon’s Diversity Index, a common measure of ecological and economic diversity that has been applied previously to economic sectors [@attaran_industrial_1986]. The Diversity Index is computed as ${ H }^{ ' }/{ H }_{ max }$ where:

$$
{ H }^{ ' } = \sum _{ i }^{ z }{ { f }_{ i }\ast  } \ln { { (f }_{ i }) }, (Eq. 7.1)
$$

and Z is the total number of sectors, $fi$ is the frequency of the ith sector (the probability that any given job belongs to the sector), and $H_{max} = \ln { Z }$.

## Economic need for artisanal fishing 
#### [ao_need](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/ao_need.csv) {-} 

These data are used to estimate the need for artisanal fishing opportunities given the purchasing power parity adjusted per capita gross domestic product (ppppcgdp) in "constant" USD (World Bank, [http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD)) [@worldbank2024]. The World Bank defines gdp as the gross value of all resident producers in the economy plus product taxes and minus and subsidies not included in the value of the products. The gdp is adjusted by population size to get per capita output and by purchasing power parity (ppp) to account for the difference in exchange rates between countries.  ppppcgdp data were rescaled to values between zero and one by taking the natural log of the values and dividing by the 99th quantile value across all years/regions (2005 to most recent year). 

When a region is missing some years of data, a within region linear model is used to estimate the missing values.

This is actually a measure of prosperity, but it is converted to need in the artisanal opportunities goal model (1 minus ppppcgdp).

Note: These data are no longer supported.  Consequently, this layer was last updated in 2013, and this goal will no longer be updated with these data.

Economies status is  calculated as:
(cur_base_value / ref_base_value) / (cur_adj_value / ref_adj_value)

Where, cur_base_value is the most recent revenue values for each sector/region, and ref_base_value is the earliest year of revenue data for each sector/region.  These values are adjusted by dividing by the GDP of corresponding region/year to control for larger economic trends. National GDP data were obtained from the World Bank ([http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ NY.GDP.MKTP.CD](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)).  For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values using a population-weighted average.

This layer includes yearly data for revenue in commercial fishing, aquarium trade fishing, mariculture, marine mammal watching, marine renewable energy, and, tourism. The data sources and methods for each sector are described below.

#### Aquarium trade fishing
To approximate revenue from aquarium fishing we used export data from the FAO Global Commodities database for ‘Ornamental fish’ for all available years. We used data from two of the four subcategories listed, excluding the subcategory ‘Fish for culture including ova, fingerlings, etc.’ because it is not specific to ornamental fish, and the subcategory ‘Ornamental freshwater fish’ because it is not from marine systems.

#### Commercial fishing
Revenue data for commercial fishing were obtained from FAO’s FishStat database, which provides yearly dollar values of commercial fisheries production for marine, brackish and freshwater species starting in 1950 and updated yearly.  To isolate production values attributable to marine and brackish aquaculture, data pertaining to freshwater species were omitted. This species classification process was very time consuming as each species had to be queried individually per year. Code from [emLab](https://github.com/SFG-UCSB/price-db-sfg) was incorporated and adapted to calculate ex-vessel prices for each year beyond 2019.

#### Mariculture
Data on revenues from marine aquaculture were derived from FAO’s FishStat database, which includes country-level data on total production values for marine, brackish, and freshwater species beginning in 1984 and updated yearly. To isolate production values attributable to marine and brackish aquaculture, data pertaining to freshwater species were omitted. This species classification process was very time consuming as each species had to be queried individually per year. There was little year-to year variation, and thus data were extracted in 5 year increments, providing data for 1997, 2002 and 2007.

#### Marine mammal watching
IFAW provides country-level data on total expenditures (including direct and indirect) attributable to the whale watching industry [@oconnor2009whale]. Here, total expenditures are used as a close proxy for total revenue. We used total expenditure data (direct and indirect expenditures) to avoid using a literature derived multiplier effect. When IFAW reported “minimal” revenue from whale watching, we converted this description to a 0 for lack of additional information. For countries with both marine and freshwater cetacean viewing, we adjusted by the proportion of marine revenue as described for the jobs dataset.

#### Marine renewable energy
The United Nations Energy Statistics Database provides production data, in kilowatt-hours (KWh), for tidal and wave electricity. However, only two countries, France and Canada, have high enough levels of production to be reported in this data source. For Canada, production data were replaced with production data (Gross Megawatt hours per year from 1995-2010) provided directly from the Annapolis tidal power plant because the plant provided a longer time series (Ruth Thorbourne, personal communication, Aug 9, 2011). To convert production data into revenue, production values were multiplied by average yearly prices of electricity per KWh specific to Canada and France, provided by the US Energy Information Administration ([http://www.eia.gov/emeu/international/elecprii.html](http://www.eia.gov/emeu/international/elecprii.html); updated June 2010) after conversion to 2010 USD. Some of the production data could not be used because there were no available electricity price data to convert production into revenue, truncating our time series.

#### Tourism 
WTTC reports dollar values of visitor exports (spending by foreign visitors) and domestic travel and tourism spending; combining these two data sets creates a proxy for total travel and tourism revenues. WTTC was chosen as the source for tourism revenue data because of the near-complete country coverage, the yearly time series component starting in 1988 and updated yearly, and the inclusion of both foreign and domestic expenditures. This dataset lumps inland and coastal/marine revenues, and so was adjusted by the percent of a country’s population within a 25 mile inland coastal zone. We included no projected data. We used total contribution to GDP data (rather than direct contribution to GDP) to avoid the use of literature derived multiplier effects.

## Exposure of ornamental fishing to coral and rocky reef habitats 
#### [np_exposure_orn](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/np_exposure_orn.csv) {-} 

Exposure is the log transformed intensity of harvest calculated as tonnes of harvest per km^2^ of coral and rocky reef of ornamental fishing, relative to the global maximum. We log transformed the harvest intensity scores because the distribution of values was highly skewed; because we do not know the true threshold of sustainable harvest, nearly all values would be considered highly sustainable without the log transformation. To estimate rocky reef extent area (km^2^) we used data from Halpern et al. [-@halpern2008global], which assumes rocky reef habitat exists in all cells within 1 km of shore. Coral extent area (km^2^) are from @unep-wcmc2018global.

For this layer, nearly identical methods were used as in the fisheries sub-goal calculations. Instead of producing scores for all global fish stocks, we only produced scores for those that contribute to fish oil and fish meal [@froehlich2020avoiding]. The tonnes of harvest of these species were multiplied by 0.7 to reflect the proportion of this catch used for oil or feed. 
 
We used SeaLifeBase [@palomares2022search] and FishBase [@froese2022fishbase] to align taxa names across datasets.

## Fishery catch data

Fisheries catch data describe the average catch across years (from 1980 to present) for each fish stock and region. We have traditionally included all fisheries catch in the Food Provision goal. However, a substantial portion of the catch is not used for human consumption, but rather for fish oil and fish meal used primarily for animal feed. To account for this, we excluded the proportion of catch that produce fish oil and fish meal for animal feed (0.9) from the total catch. These values were used to weight stock status scores (derived from B/Bmsy values) in the fisheries model. The Sea Around Us fisheries catch data [@pauly2020] is reported at EEZ and FAO Fishing Areas for taxonomic levels range from species to class to "Miscellaneous not identified" for each year. Tonnes of catch for each taxon and year were summed within each OHI region, and then the average catch across years (1980 to present) was determined for each taxon and region.

## Genetic escapes 
#### [sp_genetic](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/sp_genetic.csv) {-}

*Pressure*

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: nonindigenous species*

This layer represents the potential for harmful genetic escapement based on whether the species being cultured is native or introduced. Data come from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations [@2023monterey]. Ten mariculture practice criteria from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch (SFW) Aquaculture Recommendations contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (data quality, effluent, habitat risk, chemical use, feed, escapes, disease, source of stock, predator and wildlife mortalities, and escape of secondary species). The escapes criteria was used for this layer, where a score of 1 is the lowest, and a score of 10 is the highest. The scores reflect the potential impact of genetic escapes on local biodiversity, if these species were to escape. Genetic ‘pollution’ can arise when larvae, spats or seeds escape from poorly managed hatcheries, making native species vulnerable to outbreeding depressions and/or genetic bottlenecks. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw SFW score of 10 and minimum of 1.

These scores are country and species-specific, however, many country/species combinations are not assessed by SeaFood Watch. Given that each mariculture record must have a corresponding escapes score we used a series of steps to estimate escapes scores for every country and species. If a country/species match was available we used that, otherwise, we gapfilled using the following sequence:

1. Used the global species value provided by SeaFood Watch
2. Within a country, used average of species within the same family
3. Within a UN geo-political region, used average of species within the same family
4. Global, use average of species within the same family
5. Global, use average of species within a broad taxonomic grouping (e.g., crustaceans, algae, bivalves, etc.)
6. Finally, if these scores were not available for the categories above, we used the global average of all species. 

Seaweed or algae species were given the global seaweed escapes score provided by the Seafood Watch recommendations. We are aware that there is some bias associated with using scores derived as averages across countries because they were originally assigned to specific species-country pairs, nevertheless this is preferable to applying an escapes score solely based on a subset of the species harvested.

The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) provides a country level assessment of competitiveness in achieving sustained economic prosperity (@schwab2017global, [http://gcr.weforum.org](http://gcr.weforum.org)). The GCI is a weighted index based on 12 pillars of economic competitiveness: institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labor market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication, and innovation. The GCI can in theory span from 1 to 7, based on this range, we rescaled the scores to range between 0 and 1.  Uninhabited OHI regions are given an NA score.

## Habitat condition of coral 
#### [hab_coral_health](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/hab_coral_health.csv) {-} 


Coral condition was calculated using current condition data divided by reference condition.  We used condition data from percent live coral cover from 12,634 surveys from 1975-2006 [@bruno_regional_2016; @schutte2010regional]. When multiple data points were available for the same site and year, we averaged these data, and also averaged the site data to calculate a per country per year average. However, data were missing for several countries and some countries did not have data for the reference or current year time periods or had only 1-2 surveys. Because coral cover can be highly temporally and spatially dynamic, having only a few surveys that may have been motivated by different reasons (i.e., documenting a pristine or an impacted habitat) can bias results. To calculate condition we used fitted values from a linear trend of all data per country, which was more robust to data poor situations and allowed us to take advantage of periods of intense sampling that did not always include both current and reference years. Then, we created a fitted linear model of all these data points from 1975-2010, provided that 2 or more points are in 1980-1995 and 2 or more points are in 2000-2010. We defined the ‘current’ condition (health) as the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010, and the reference condition as the mean of the predicted values for 1985-1987. Where country data were not available, we used an average from adjacent EEZs weighted by habitat area, or a georegional average weighted by habitat area, based on countries within the same ocean basin (Figure 7.1).

Soft bottom subtidal habitat condition was calculated using data from the Global Fishing Effort Model Data and Shiny App [@clawson_global_2025]. This data spatially allocated industrial fishing effort based off multiple data sources, and we filtered for gear type "Trawl_Bottom" prior to downloading. This data includes active fishing hours recorded at the 1 degree pixel resolution. 

Because the distribution of fishing effort values for each region was extremely skewed, we took transformed them by taking the natural log using $log(X+1)$ of fishing hours divided by pixel area and then rescaled the values by dividing by the 99.9th quantile of density for the 2010 data. Any rescaled density value greater than 1.0 was capped at 1.0. Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled fishing effort density for each year and region.

## Habitat condition trend of mangrove 
#### [hab_mangrove_trend](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/hab_mangrove_trend.csv) {-}


We used Global Mangrove Watch [-@bunting2022global] mangrove extent data to estimate the proportional yearly change in mangrove area using a linear regression model of years from 2007 up to the year in question. This length of data is longer than we usually do (typically 5 years), but we feel we get a better estimate using this period of time. Proportional yearly change is determined by first dividing yearly extents by the extent from the earliest year in the model. Year is then regressed on those proportions, and the resulting slope is multiplied by 5 to get the predicted change in five years. The original mangrove extent data are provided yearly (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) in the form of polygons - these are subsequently rasterized to match our regions and extract the area.

Trend in seagrass condition was determined using three data sources [@waycott2009accelerating, @short2011extinction, @iucn_spatial_2022). Short et al. [-@short2011extinction] measured percent percent cover on a per sample, per site, per year basis, and determined species population trends (increasing, decreasing, or stable). The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species also provides species population trends (increasing, decreasing, or stable). Waycott et al. [-@waycott2009accelerating] measured habitat area on a per site, per year basis. We used the population trends from @short2011extinction and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species [@iucn2024] to assign population trends to the IUCN species distribution maps [@iucn_spatial_2022]. Then we used median rate of change per year (%) from Waycott et al. [-@waycott2009accelerating] (Table S2) to assign numerical trend values to each species population trend (-0.0767 for decreasing, 0 for stable, and 0.0845 for increasing). Following this we gapfill missing trends first by species family average, and then by the global seagrass average trend. We calculate the trend per OHI region using an average weighted by species distribution area. Finally, where country data were not available, we gapfill by the georegional average.

#### [hab_tidal_flat_trend](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/hab_tidal_flat_trend.csv) {-} 


We used the [Murray Global Intertidal Change Dataset](https://www.intertidal.app/home) [@murray_2019] tidal flat extent data to estimate the proportional yearly change in tidal flat area using a linear regression model of years from 2001 up to 2013. This length of data is longer than we usually do (typically 5 years), but we feel we get a better estimate using this period of time. Proportional yearly change is determined by regressing extent on year, and the resulting slope is divided by the extent from the earliest year in the model and multiplied by 5 to get the predicted change in five years.

*Pressure*

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: fishing pressure*

This layer describes the relative pressure of high bycatch artisanal fishing practices for each OHI region. The fishery data [@watson2019global] describe catch (tonnes) for each species at the 0.5 degree raster global scale for both non-industrial and industrial fishing. For each raster cell, we summed catch discards from the non-industrial global catch data.  

The catch was then divided by the mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2^/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM,  [http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/), 0.5 degree global raster data) [@omalleyocean]. Standardizing catch by primary productivity controls for the fact that similar amounts of catch impart different pressures depending on the productivity in the region. 

The layer was rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile of the entire data layer across all years of data.  

To summarize at the OHI region scale, the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.

## IUCN extinction risk 
#### [ico_spp_iucn_status](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/ico_spp_iucn_status.csv) {-} 

This data layer provides the risk category and the year the species was assessed from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ([http://www.iucnredlist.org/](http://www.iucnredlist.org/)) [@iucn_iucn_2025] for the iconic species in each region. Regionally specific IUCN risk category data for *subpopulations* are included where available. Trend calculations are based on the change in each species' IUCN risk category over time, based upon past and current IUCN assessments.

OHI defines iconic species as those relevant to local cultural identity through the species’ relationship to traditional activities such as fishing, hunting, commerce or involvement in local ethnic or religious practices; and species with locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common artistic subjects such as whales). Habitat forming species are excluded in this definition of iconic species. The OHI global iconic species list combines three species lists from WWF Global: global priorities, regional and local priorities, and flagship species. It also incorporates culturally important species [@garcia2023]. The criteria for including species on these lists are consistent with the OHI’s definition of iconic species. 

Once the species lists were obtained, each species was assigned to a region based on native range countries from the IUCN Red List. 

Most of the iconic species are not region specific, and the global list is applied across all regions. However, some countries have developed national priority and flagship species lists in conjunction with WWF. These region-specific iconic species lists supplement the global list for those specific countries only. In addition, as countries and regions conduct OHI regional assessments ([http://ohi-science.org/projects/](http://ohi-science.org/projects/)), we will use the iconic species list developed by those countries/regions to supplement our global model. For example, iconic species identified for the Baltic Health Index regional assessment have been included for all countries bordering the Baltic Sea. Additional culturally important species were added to supplement the original iconic species list [@garcia2023]. These culturally important species are listed as iconic at the continent level. Species are considered iconic for all regions where they are present within the continent they are listed.

## Livelihood status scores 
#### [liv_status](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/liv_status.csv) {-} 

This layer provides calculated status values for the livelihoods subgoal.  Livelihoods is calculated using job and wage data from marine sectors. 

Note: These data are no longer supported.  Consequently, this layer was last updated in 2013, and this goal will no longer be updated with these data.

Livelihoods status is generally calculated as:
(cur_base_value / ref_base_value) / (cur_adj_value / ref_adj_value)

Where, cur_base_value is the most recent value (i.e., jobs or wages) for each sector/region, and ref_base_value is the value for the earliest year of data for each sector/region.  These values are adjusted to control for larger trends within the region. For example, jobs data for the livelihoods subgoal was adjusted by dividing by the percent employment of the corresponding year. For wage data, the adjustment was done a bit differently by multiplying wages by GDPpcPPP for each year/region to make wages comparable.   

### Jobs
Jobs includes yearly data for commercial fishing, mariculture, marine mammal watching, marine renewable energy, and, tourism. The data sources and methods for each sector are described below.

Percent employment during the current status year for each sector/region is calculated as (1 - percent unemployment)*total labor force (World Bank).  Jobs data for the livelihoods subgoal were adjusted by dividing by the percent employment in the corresponding year.

#### Commercial fishing
Data are from the [OECD (Employment in fisheries, aquaculture, and processing, 2009-2021)](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?fs[0]=Topic%2C1%7CAgriculture%20and%20fisheries%23AGR%23%7CFisheries%20and%20aquaculture%23AGR_FSA%23&pg=0&fc=Topic&bp=true&snb=6&vw=ov&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_FISH_EMP%40DF_FISH_EMPL&df[ag]=OECD.TAD.ARP&df[vs]=1.0&dq=.A...._T._T&pd=2009%2C&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false&ly[cl]=TIME_PERIOD&ly[rs]=REF_AREA&ly[rw]=DOMAIN) [@organisation_for_economic_co-operation_and_development_oecd_employment_2025]. The data are filtered for the number of people working in the marine and subsistence fishing sectors. The OECD data are supplemented with additional data from the table on pg. 169 of the [FAO Yearbook 2021](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/2be6c2fa-07b1-429d-91c5-80d3d1af46a6/content) [@food_and_agriculture_organization_of_the_united_nations_fishery_2024] and [ILOSTAT](https://rshiny.ilo.org/dataexplorer46/?lang=en&id=EAR_4MTH_SEX_ECO_CUR_NB_A) for "Rev 3.1.B: Fishing" [@international_labour_organization_employment_2025].

#### Mariculture
Data are from the [OECD (Employment in fisheries, aquaculture, and processing, 2009-2021)](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?df[ds]=DisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_SOE%40DF_SOE&df[ag]=OECD.ENV.EPI&dq=.A....&pd=1995%2C2024&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false&vw=tb) [@organisation_for_economic_co-operation_and_development_oecd_sustainable_2025]. The data are filtered for "People employed in aquaculture sector." The OECD data are supplemented with additional data from the table on pg. 170 of the [FAO Yearbook 2021](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/2be6c2fa-07b1-429d-91c5-80d3d1af46a6/content) [@food_and_agriculture_organization_of_the_united_nations_fishery_2024]

#### Marine mammal watching
The International Fund for Animal Welfare’s (IFAW) Whale Division provides time series data on whale watching in more than 115 coastal countries [@oconnor2009whale]. This dataset may be an imperfect representation of all marine mammal watching due to its focus on whales, although it does include data for other types of marine mammal watching (e.g., dolphins). However, to our knowledge, it is the most complete dataset pertaining to the global marine mammal watching industry. We obtained regional averages of the number of whale watchers per employee, as well as the number of whale watchers in each country. Using this information, we estimated the number of whale watching jobs in each country by dividing the country’s total number of whale watchers by the average number of whale watchers per employee for that country’s region (e.g., Africa & Middle East, Europe, North America). It is important to note that data are not annual, but there are at least four years of data for each country.
When IFAW reported “minimal” numbers of whale watchers, we converted this description to a 0 for lack of additional information. Because some of the whale watching in O’Connor et al. focused on freshwater cetacean viewing, we categorized the target species listed for each country as freshwater or marine. For countries with both marine and freshwater species, we categorized the whale watching in those countries as either 50% or 90% marine, based on the number of marine versus freshwater target species and information provided in the report narrative. For Colombia and Indonesia, more detailed information in the report narrative allowed for a more precise determination of the percentage of marine-based whale watching. We applied these marine proportions to data on the number of whale watchers before converting these estimates into employment estimates.

#### Marine renewable energy
The number of marine renewable energy jobs was determined for the two countries, France and Canada, which produce significant enough amounts of tidal energy to register with the UN Energy Statistics Database [http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=EDATA&f=cmID%3aEO](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=EDATA&f=cmID%3aEO).  For the La Rance plant in France, employment information was obtained from a recent press statement (EDF 2011); we assumed employment stayed constant over the time period for which we had production data for this plant, given relatively consistent or even growing production. For the Annopolis Royal plant in Canada, we received yearly employment information from the plant (Ruth Thorbourne, personal communication, Aug 9 2011).

Marine renewable energy includes five major technologies: tidal barrages, marine currents, waves, ocean thermal converters and salinity gradients. However, we only include data for the largest tidal barrage plants, as these data are available. 

#### Tourism
The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) provides data on travel and tourism’s total contribution to employment for 180 countries ([http://www.wttc.org/eng/Tourism_Research/Economic_Data_Search_Tool/](http://www.wttc.org/eng/Tourism_Research/Economic_Data_Search_Tool/)). Although other global data sources on tourism are available (i.e., United Nations World Tourism Organization, UNTWO), the WTTC database was chosen because it offers yearly time series data that span through the current year, it includes nearly complete coverage of all nations, and it disaggregates direct and total (direct plus indirect) employment impacts of tourism. WTTC provides projected data, however, we do not use these values. We used total employment data to avoid the use of literature derived multiplier effects. The WTTC shares a significant drawback with UNTWO data, in that data on coastal/marine and inland tourism are lumped. Therefore, a country-specific coefficient must be applied to estimate the jobs provided by coastal/marine tourism alone. We adjusted national tourism data by the proportion of a country’s population that lives within a 25 mile inland coastal zone.

### Wages

Wages were multiplied by GDPpcPPP for each country/year to make values comparable. 

We used the Occupational Wages around the World (OWW) database produced by Remco H. Oostendorp and Richard B. Freeman in 2005 ([http://www.nber.org/oww/](http://www.nber.org/oww/)). These data were drawn from the International Labour Organization and subjected to a standardization process (for more information, see [http://www.nber.org/oww/Technical _document_1983-2003_standardizationv3.pdf](http://www.nber.org/oww/Technical _document_1983-2003_standardizationv3.pdf)). The database provides several different calibrations, and we use the “x3wl calibration”, described as a “country-specific and uniform calibration with lexicographic weighting,” and recommended as being the preferred calibration in most cases. Although significant gaps exist in this database, it contains country-specific information on average wages in many industries for more than 150 countries from 1983-2003. Data represent average monthly wages of a male worker. Wage data were divided by the inflation conversion factor for 2010 so that wage data across years would be comparable ([http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr](http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr)), and then multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita gdp (ppppcgdp, WorldBank).  The adjusted wage data were then multiplied by 12 to get annual wages. We used the industry and occupation classifications reported in the OWW to estimate wages for marine-related sectors.

**Table 7.6. Occupation classification for wage data sectors**

Sector | Occupation classifications
------- | -----------------------------------------------
Commercial fishing | Industry: deep sea & coastal fishing; <br>Occupations: deep sea fisher; inshore (coastal) maritime fisherman
Ports & harbors | Industry: supporting services to maritime transport; <br> Occupation: dock worker
Ship & boat building | Industry: shipbuilding and repairing; <br> Occupation: ship plater
Tourism | Industry: restaurants and hotels; <br> Occupations: hotel  receptionist; cook; waiter; room attendant or chambermaid. <br> These data are not specific to coastal/marine tourism jobs, and thus we assumed that wages in these jobs are equal in coastal and non-coastal areas
Transportation & shipping | Industry: maritime transport; <br> Occupations: ship's chief engineer; ship's passenger stewards; able seaman

*Pressure*

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: fishing pressure*

This layer describes the relative pressure of low bycatch artisanal fishing practices for each OHI region. The fishery data [@watson2019global] describe catch (tonnes) for each species at the 0.5 degree raster global scale for both non-industrial and industrial fishing. For each raster cell, we summed catch (which consisted of reported landings as well as illegal, unreported and regulated catch) from the non-industrial global catch data.  

The catch was then divided by the mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2^/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM,  [http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/), 0.5 degree global raster data) [@omalleyocean]. Standardizing catch by primary productivity controls for the fact that similar amounts of catch impart different pressures depending on the productivity in the region. 

The layer was rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile of the entire data layer across all years of data.  

To summarize at the OHI region scale, the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.

Seaweeds that are partially consumed as food were weighted with a value between 0 and 1 that represents the proportion of the yield used as food. All species produced within a country were summed to give a single production value for each country in each year that production took place. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values by summing across these EEZs.

## Mariculture sustainability score 
#### [mar_sustainability_score](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/mar_sustainability_score.csv) {-} 

Ten mariculture practice criteria from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations [@2023monterey] contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (data quality, effluent, habitat risk, chemical use, feed, escapes, disease, source of stock, predator and wildlife mortalities, and escape of secondary species). These criteria represent the internal mariculture practices with the potential to affect the long term sustainability of the mariculture system. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum raw Seafood Watch score and minimum of 0, under the assumption that the highest score is the best possible given current technologies.

These scores are country and species-specific, however, many country/species combinations are not assessed by Seafood Watch. Given that each mariculture record must have a corresponding sustainability score we used a series of steps to estimate sustainability scores for every country and species. If a country/species match was available we used that, otherwise, we gapfilled using the following sequence:
1. Used the global species value provided by SeaFood Watch
2. Within a country, used average of species within the same family
3. Within a UN geo-political region, used average of species within the same family
4. Global, use average of species within the same family
5. Global, use average of species within a broad taxonomic grouping (e.g., crustaceans, algae, bivalves, etc.)
6. Finally, if these scores were not available for the categories above, we used the global average of all species. 

Seaweed or algae species were given the global seaweed sustainability score provided by the Seafood Watch recommendations. We are aware that there is some bias associated with using scores derived as averages across countries because they were originally assigned to specific species-country pairs, nevertheless this is preferable to applying a sustainability score solely based on a subset of the species harvested.
 
**Table 7.8. Mariculture sustainability criteria**

Criteria         | Description of practice and score scheme
----------------- | ----------------------------------------
Data     | Poor data quality and availability limits the ability to assess and understand the impacts of aquaculture production. It also does not enable informed choices for seafood purchasers or enable businesses to be held accountable for their impacts. A score between 1 and 10 was given based on data availability, quality, and confidence. 
Effluent    | Aquaculture species, production systems and management methods vary in the amount of waste produced per unit of production. The combined discharge of farms, groups of farms or industries contribute to local and regional nutrient loads. A score of 1 to 10 is given based on the concern of the effluent produced from the practices. 
Habitats   | Aquaculture farms can be located in a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitat types and have greatly varying levels of impact to both pristine and previously modified habitats as well as to the critical “ecosystem services” they provide. Scores are based on whether they are located at sites, scales and intensities that maintain the functionality of ecologically valuable habitats.
Chemical use | Improper use of chemical treatments impacts non-target organisms and leads to production losses and human health concerns due to the development of chemical-resistant organisms. Scores are based on if facilities limit the type, frequency of use, total use, or discharge of chemicals to levels representing a low risk of impact to non-target organisms. 
Feed | Feed consumption, feed type, ingredients used and the net nutritional gains or losses vary dramatically between farmed species and production systems. Producing feeds and their ingredients has complex global ecological impacts, and the efficiency of conversion can result in net food gains or dramatic net losses of nutrients. Feed use is considered to be one of the defining factors of aquaculture sustainability. Scores are based on whether facilities source sustainable feed ingredients and convert them efficiently with net edible nutrition gains.
Escapes | Competition, altered genetic composition, predation, habitat damage, spawning disruption, and other impacts on wild fish and ecosystems resulting from the escape of native, non-native and/or genetically distinct fish or other unintended species from aquaculture operations. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to wild species or other ecosystem-level impacts from farm escapes.
Disease, pathogen and parasite interaction | Amplification of local pathogens and parasites on fish farms and their transmission or retransmission to local wild species that share the same water body. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to wild species through the amplification and retransmission, or increased virulence of pathogens or parasites. 
Source of stock | The removal of fish from wild populations for growing to harvest size in farms. Scores are based on whether facilities use eggs, larvae, or juvenile fish produced from farm-raised broodstocks thereby avoiding the need for wild capture.
Predator and wildlife mortalities | Mortality of predators or other wildlife caused or contributed to by farming operations. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to predators or other species of wildlife attracted to farm sites. 
Escape of secondary species | Movement of live animals resulting in introduction of unintended species. Scores are based on whether facilities avoid the potential for the accidental introduction of secondary species or pathogens resulting from the shipment of animals.

Fisheries management was determined using governance capacity data from the [Minderoo Global Fishing Index](https://www.minderoo.org/global-fishing-index/) [@travaille2022minderoo]. This governance capacity data characterizes the development of a country's fisheries governance system on a continuum from zero to 12, based on each country's assessment score and balance across the [Governance Conceptual Framework](https://cdn.minderoo.org/content/uploads/2021/11/19141814/20211112-global-fishing-index-2021-conceptual-framework.pdf). The assessment score rages from 0-100 and is based on a region's performance across 6 dimensions of fisheries governance and weights each of these dimensions unequally, based on survey responses from fisheries experts:

Dimension | Definition | Weight
----------|------------|-------
Policy and objectives | Assesses a country's fisheries policy foundation and governance and management objectives | 22%
Management capacity | Assesses a country's fisheries policy foundation and governance and management objectives | 14%
Information availability and monitoring | Assesses the range, quality and resolution of the fisheries information available to inform management decisions | 16%
Level and control of access to fisheries resources | Assesses the extent of fishing access granted to various fleets and the tools used to regulate access across these fleets | 15%
Compliance management system | Assesses the strength of a country's fisheries compliance and enforcement program | 17%
Stakeholder engagement and participation | Assesses the capacity of stakeholders, including fishers and fish processors, governmental and non-governmental organizations, research institutions and local communities, to meaningfully participate in fisheries governance and management processes | 16%

For more information about these variables and how they are calculated, see the following documentation by the Minderoo Global Fishing Index:\
- [Methodology](https://www.minderoo.org/global-fishing-index/methodology/)\
- [Technical Documentation](https://cdn.minderoo.org/content/uploads/2021/11/05140059/20220505-global-fishing-index-2021-technical-methods.pdf#page=13)\
- [Indicator Codebook](https://cdn.minderoo.org/content/uploads/2021/11/19141816/20211112-global-fishing-index-2021-indicator-codebook.pdf)

To gapfill the governance capacity data, we used gross domestic product (GDP) converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant international dollars based on the 2011 ICP round. We used the `predict()` function from the `stats` package to gapfill governance capacity using the GDP and United Nations geopolitical regions as predictor variables. Uninhabited regions received no score.

The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) is a series of country-wise checklists of introduced (naturalized) and invasive (harmful) species [@pagad_2018]. These data report the number and type of introduced and invasive species for each country, with species habitat listed under marine, brackish, freshwater, terrestrial, or some combination thereof. We only select species listed as marine or brackish, including those which are listed in combination with other habitat types (typically birds, plants, and insects which intersect multiple habitats). For our purposes, a weighted average of invasive species (90%) and introduced species (10%) were used to calculate the score. This split was made to account for unreliable data on the harm caused by introduced species, especially in marine environments, and to capture data inaccuracies in the overall dataset from reporting on the distinction between introduced and invasive species from individual countries. OHI regions with no data reported are gapfilled with regional averages. All values are rescaled to between 0 and 1.  

$$
Pressure = 0.1 * \frac{S_n - min(S_n)}{max(S_n) - min(S_n)} + 0.9 * \frac{S_h - min(S_h)}{max(S_h) - min(S_h)}
$$

Where,

$S_n$ = number of introduced (naturalized) species in the region.

$min(S_n)$ = the minimum number of introduced (naturalized) species in all regions.

$max(S_n)$ = the maximum number of introduced (naturalized) species in all regions.

$S_h$ = number of invasive (harmful) species in the region.

$min(S_h)$ = the minimum number of invasive (harmful) species in all regions.

$max(S_h)$ = the maximum number of invasive (harmful) species in all regions.

Predicting the full potential impact of alien species depends in large part on having high-resolution spatial information on where they exist, how far they have spread and exactly which components of the food web they affect. The data from @pagad_2018 approximate these impacts but at country scales. In addition, the impacts of introduced and invasive species will vary depending on the goal under consideration. This implies that harmful effects would need to be assessed separately for each goal. Such an endeavor may be possible when applying this framework to a smaller case-study where this type of information can be acquired.

Data were calculated using modeled plumed of land-based nitrogen pollution that provide intensity of pollution at 0.5 degree gridded resolution. 

Nitrogen pollution was estimated from FAO data on annual country level fertilizer application for agricultural use ([https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RFN](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RFN); @unitednations2022faostata) and country level estimates of nitrogen (N) inputs to agricultural soils from livestock manure ([https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EMN](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EMN); @unitednations2021faostat).  

**Disaggregating fertilizer application at the crop-level**

First, we extracted national fertilizer application for agricultural use from FAOSTAT [-@unitednations2022faostata] for each plant nutrient (N, P2O5, and K2O). To disaggregate national fertilizer application at the crop-level, we compiled fertilizer use by crop (FUBC) rates from the International Fertilizer Association’s (IFA) FUBC series [@faoifaifdc_fertilizer_2002; @heffer2017assessment], FUBC rates provided by request. The FUBC series provides national application rates, measured in kilograms per hectare, of N, P2O5, and K2O for all crop categories. FUBC rates for 2014/15 were extracted from Heffer et al. [-@heffer2017assessment] (FUBC rates provided by request),  and harmonised with general crop categories, with the exception of fodder, which is not included, and the residual category, which combines crop categories from our study that are unlikely to have similar fertilizer application rates. hence, we extracted FUBC rates for these remaining crop categories and fodder by extracting crop-specific FUBC rates from FAO [-@faoifaifdc_fertilizer_2002]. While these rates are more specific at the national and crop level, they were reported between 1996-2001, which is relatively old compared to FUBC rates for 2014/15. To gapfill missing national rates for FUBC 2002, we used the mean fertilizer rate using the smallest regional mean or adopting the next largest regional mean if the smaller region had no data [@2020unsd]. We also allocated national fertilizer use to grasslands using 2014/15 FUBC percentages.

To determine the proportion of fertilizer allocated by country, crop, production system, and fertilizer, we multiplied crop-specific rates by the total national harvested area of each crop and production system calculated from SPAM harvested area maps (production maps taken from @halpern2022cumulative, in review). Because the SPAM harvested area maps are only from data year 2017, the location of fertilizer use does not change across years, only relative intensity does. Fertilizer inputs to irrigated high input production systems were weighted two times higher than high-input rain-fed production systems for the same production [@fao2005fertilizer], while the two other production systems (low input and subsistence) were assigned a weight of zero as they do not require fertilizer use. The proportion of nutrient applied was calculated for each country, crop, production system, and fertilizer. We disaggregated national fertilizer application by multiplying national fertilizer with the proportions. We disaggregated national fertilizer input at the raster level by multiplying the cell-level proportion of harvested area in the country for each crop and production system with the national fertilizer use.


**Calculating excess nitrogen from synthetic fertilizer applied to crops**

Excess nutrients from crops were estimated using the proportion of N that is leached, and the proportion of N that is volatilised as NH3. We define excess nitrogen, $N_{excess}$, as the tonnes of applied nitrogen that likely runsoffs/leaches, Nleach, or volatilizes as NH3, $N_{{vol}_{NH3}}$, which is subsequently deposited on land and water:  

$N_{excess} = N_{{vol}_{NH3}} + N_{leach}$

where, 

$N_{leach} = N_{applied} – N_{withdrawal} –  N_{nitrification/denitrification} – N_{{vol}_{NH3}}$

$N_{withdrawal}$ = estimates of withdrawal of N by plants on both crops and grazed areas at supernational scale (NUE values from @bouwman2005nitrogen).

$N_{nitrification/denitrification}$ = estimate of N emissions through nitrification/denitrification processes (e.g., N20, NO, N2), with a global estimate of 10.2% used [@bouwman2002modeling; @scheer2020estimating].  

$N_{{vol}_{NH3}}$ = estimates of N volatilization as NH3 at supernational scale (@bouwman2002estimation, Table 5 summed grasslands, crops, wetland rice).


**Calculating excess nitrogen from livestock manure pathways**

We estimated for four general manure pathways (managed then spread, spread on soil, spread on pasture, left on pasture) the proportion of excreted N [@unitednations2021faostat] that is removed by plants, volatilizes as NH3, is converted to NOx products during nitrification/denitrification, or, is lost through leaching or runoff (Fig. 7.2).

**Figure 7.2. Nitrogen leaching and volatilization from manure pathways.**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/metadata_documentation/ohi_model/layers_info/figures/manure_pathways.png)
For manure applied to crop soils or pastures or left on pastures, we generally estimated the proportion of N that runs off or leaches, $PN_{leach}$, as:

$PN_{leach} = 1 – PN_{withdrawal} – PN_{nitrification/denitrification} – PN_{vol_{NH3}}$

where the values vary according to the manure pathway (Table 7.9).

**Table 7.9. Values used to estimate proportion of N loss due to withdrawal, nitrification/denitrification, and NH3 volatilization for different manure systems** 

|   | **Definition**  | **Applied to crops**  | **Applied or left on pastures**  |
|---|---|---|---|
| $PN_{withdrawal}$  |  Proportion of withdrawal of N by crops or grasses | Proportion of N recovery, Table 5 in [@bouwman2005nitrogen]  |  60% of inputs post NH3 volatilization [@bouwman2005nitrogen] |
| $PN_{nitrification/denitrification}$  | Proportion of N emissions through nitrification/denitrification processes (e.g., N20, NO, N2)  | Global value of 0.102; calculated as N2O emission factor of 0.01 of total N excretion [@bouwman2002modeling] multiplied by 10.2 based on the ratio of (N2O + N2)/N2O for “agricultural soils” [@scheer2020estimating].   | Global value of 0.09125 used; calculated as N2O emission factor of 0.01 of total N excretion [@bouwman2002modeling] multiplied by 9.125 based on the ratio of (N2O + N2)/ N2O for “soils under natural vegetation” [@scheer2020estimating]  |
| $PN_{vol_{NH3}}$  | Proportion of volatilization as NH3  | Proportion of volatilization (Table 5 in Bouwman et al. [-@bouwman2002estimation] avg. of crops and rice values)  |  Proportion of grassland volatilization, Table 5 in Bouwman et al. [-@bouwman2002estimation] |
 
 
In some cases, prior to being spread on soils, manure is collected and stored using a variety of management systems, s.  The proportion of N leaching from manure management systems, $PMMS_{leach}$, was calculated using a modified version of GLEAM equation 4.4.4 [@fao2018global]:

$PMMS_{leach} = ∑_s (MS_s  × F_{leach,s}  × (1 - ex_{vol}))$

$MMS_{leach}$  = proportion N leached for managed manure for animal system

$MS_s$ = Fraction of manure treated in each system, s [@fao2018global]

$F_{leach,s}$ = Fraction N leached in each manure management system [@fao2018global]

$ex_{vol}$  = Fraction N volatilized after excretion, used global value of 0.0075 [@fao2018global]

To determine the proportion of N volatilizing as NH3 for manure treated in a manure management system, we determined the total proportion of all N lost during management (Table 10.23 in @gavrilova2019chapter). Nitrogen loss includes runoff/leaching, volatilization of NH3, and NOx from denitrification/nitrification. We subtracted the proportion expected to leach in each manure management system [@fao2018global].  The remaining loss included both NH3 volatilization and NOx from nitrification/denitrification, so we used an adjustment factor of 0.74 to account for only NH3 volatilization of N, based on the proportion of NH3/(NH3 + NOx) observed in directly applied manure.

Eventually, the managed manure is typically applied to either crop soils or pasture soils. Using the same assumption as @bouwman2009human, in industrialized countries we applied 50% of manure to pastures and 50% to crops, and in developing countries we applied 95% to crop land and 5% to pastures. 

Next, for each livestock system and country, we estimated the total proportion of N that runsoffs/leaches, $PN_{leach}$, or volatilizes as NH3, $PN_{NH3}$ based on the proportion of manure, $P_{manure}$, that enters each manure pathway for a given livestock system and country (@fao2018global, Figure 7.2): 

\begin{align*}
               PN_{leach} = P_{manure}  \times PMMS_{leach} + \\
               P_{manure}  \times PAppliedCrops_{leach} + \\
               P_{manure}  \times PAppliedPastures_{leach} + \\
P_{manure}  \times PLeftPastures_{leach}
\end{align*}

We estimated $PN_{NH3}$ similarly.

For each livestock system, we then mapped the yearly tonnes of N that leaches or runsoff from manure, $rastTN_{leach}$:

$rastTN_{leach} = rastPN_{leach} \times rastN_{ex} \times rastN_{animals}$

where,

$rastPN_{leach}$ = rasterized data describing total proportion of N runoff/leaching for a specific animal system and country 

$rastN_{ex}$  = raster describing annual N excretion, tonnes N animal-1 year-1 (country and animal specific values from @unitednations2021faostat)

$rastN_{animals}$ = raster data describing number of animals for an animal system [@fao2018global]

	
We similarly mapped the total tonnes of N that volatilizes as NH3. 


**N leaching and N volatilization from synthetic fertilizers applied to grassland**

We calculated national agricultural grassland fertilizer input by multiplying the national agricultural fertilizer input with the percentage of fertilizer allocated to grasslands nationally in 2014/15 [@heffer2017assessment]. We assumed all agricultural grassland fertilizer input was used on grass fed to livestock. To spatially disaggregate national fertilizer input, we multiplied national fertilizer input by the proportion of livestock units (LSU) for each country, animal and product (milk, meat, etc.) at the cell-level. 

To calculate excess nutrients from synthetic fertilizers applied to grasslands, we estimated the proportion of N that is leached, and the proportion of N that is volatilized as NH3 (Figure 7.2). Methods are the same as manure pathways, with the exception of using grassland-specific proportions to calculate $N_{{vol}_{NH3}}$ [@bouwman2002estimation].


**Pluming excess nitrogen to coastal areas**

Final excess nitrogen layers from crop fertilizer and livestock manure were then combined together to create rasters describing excess nitrogen leaching at 0.5 degree gridded resolution and excess nitrogen volatilization at 0.5 degree gridded resolution. To estimate the amount of leached nitrogen which reaches coastal systems we assumed that any nitrogen which was more than 1km away from surface waters and coastlines would not contribute to effluent totals. To estimate the amount of volatilized nitrogen which reaches coastal systems, we multiplied yearly volatilized raster by a raster describing proportion of area within cells that are surface waters and cells that are 1km away from the coast. This was done under the assumption that all leaching and volatilization would not reach coastal areas due to uptake from soils and other processes. Surface water rasters were provided upon request from Tuholske [-@tuholske2021]. Following this, we combined the coastal leaching and coastal volatilization rasters into single, yearly pollution rasters. 


These yearly pollution rasters were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~95,000 were aggregated into 0.5 degree gridded Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster for each year from 2005 to 2020. 

These raw values were then normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99th quantile of raster values across all years.  The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.

This pressure layer models the difference in global distribution of the aragonite saturation state ($\Omega_{arag}$) of the ocean in the pre-industrial era and modern times. Global estimates through time [@CMSpaper2024] are modeled at 1-degree resolution. Changes in the saturation state can be attributed to changes in the concentration of CO~2~ and thus we use the difference between the pre-industrial and modern times as a proxy for ocean acidification due to human influences [@barker2012; @usepa2024]. Values are rescaled from 0 to 1 using the threshold at which seawater becomes undersaturated, where $\Omega_{arag} = 1$, and by relating the current aragonite saturation to a historical reference.

We used only WDPA polygons (not points) with a status of “designated” (not “proposed”). These polygons were converted to a 500 m Mollweide raster by the value of the year in which the park was decreed “designated”. For cases in which polygons overlapped, priority was given first to the parks with the earliest year.

#### [cw_trash_trend](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/cw_trash_trend.csv) {-} 

Trend in trash was estimated using data on improperly disposed of plastics (Jambeck et al. 2016). Data are from the supplement, and describe mismanaged plastic waste in 2010 and projected mismanaged plastic waste in 2025. Using these data, we estimates proportional trash trends during a 5 year period as follows: 

$trend_{15year} = (value_{2025} - value_{2010})/value_{2010}$

$trend_{1year} = trend_{15year}/15$

The trend_1year value was then multiplied by 5 to get the estimated proportional change in 5 years.

Missing data was gapfilled using a linear regression model with population as a predictor.

## Potential tonnes of mariculture harvest 
#### [mar_capacity](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/mar_capacity.csv) {-} 

Mariculture capacity/potential was determined for each region using Mapping the global potential for marine aquaculture [@gentry2019exploring]. Global data were provided at 0.0083 degree resolution. The total mariculture capacity count data was calculated for each region by extracting the relevant cell data using the OHI regions shapefile.

## Proportion of total international arrivals to area of coastline to total population 
#### [tr_arrivals_props_tourism](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/tr_arrivals_props_tourism.csv) {-} 

The [United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)](https://www.unwto.org/) [-@unwto2024arrivals] includes total international arrivals data. This is provided in the form of thousands of people arriving, which we convert to total number of people arriving. We divide these arrivals by the total arrivals in the country.

To address missing values in arrivals, specifically referring to "Overnight visitors (tourists)," we employ a two-step process. First, we attempt to fill the gaps by subtracting "Same-day visitors (excursionists)" from "Total arrivals" if the latter is available. If this is not feasible, we resort to interpolating or extrapolating based on historical data spanning from 1995 to 2019, employing a linear model to estimate increases or decreases on a regional level.

In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have adopted a distinct approach for the years 2020 and 2021. We calculate the global average proportionate change from the preceding year, apply this percentage change to the previous year's arrivals or total values, and then add the result to the corresponding previous year's arrivals or total value.

## Region areas based on EEZ boundaries 
#### [rgn_area](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/rgn_area.csv) {-} 

Area (km^2^) for each region's EEZ-based boundary. 

OHI offshore regions are based on exclusive economic zones (EEZ, VLIZ 2012). Unique country EEZs were typically used to define a region, except territorial regions were split from the administrative country.  Many borders have been redrawn, such as the removal of UK claims around Cyprus. Gaps and extensions between this EEZ file and our land-sea mask were resolved through GIS operations (buffer, erase, and polygon neighbor analysis). Ocean area per region was calculated using geodesic area calculations on the region polygons in geographic coordinates. We exclude from regions the inland EEZs of the Caspian Sea and any disputed areas.

## Relative natural product harvest value 
#### [np_harvest_product_weight](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/np_harvest_product_weight.csv) {-} 

Within each region and year, the 5 year average value (USD) of harvest of each commodity (ornamental fish, seaweeds, and fish oil/fish meal) relative to 5 year average total harvest value of three marine commodities. This layer is used to weight contribution of each product to final natural product status score. The FAO Global Commodities database was used for this layer [@un-fao2024].

If a country was missing tonnes or dollar values (but had one of the values), the missing data were estimated. FAO provides yearly data for the tonnes and dollar value generated for each natural product, however, countries often provide only one of these variables (and the data provided varies across years). To estimate these missing data, we used country-specific linear models to predict tonnes based on the dollar value of a product (or, vice versa). For the countries that did not have enough data to develop an adequate model, our models included the data for all the countries within a UN geopolitical region. When there was not enough data at the geopolitical region scale, we used all the global data to predict missing values.

## Relative ornamental natural product harvest tonnes 
#### [np_orn_tonnes_relative](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/np_orn_tonnes_relative.csv) {-} 

The total tonnes of ornamental fish were determined for each region using export data from the FAO Global Commodities database [@un-fao2024]. For each group the sum of the subcategories was calculated.  For ornamental fish we excluded the subcategory ‘Fish for culture including ova, fingerlings, etc.’ because it is not specific to ornamental fish, and the subcategory ‘Ornamental freshwater fish’ because it is not from marine systems. Following this, within each region, the harvest of ornamental fishing was scaled relative to its maximum value across all years. The tonnes of ornamental fishing is divided by the maximum value observed for the commodity in each region. 

If a country was missing tonnes or dollar values (but had one of the values), the missing data were estimated. FAO provides yearly data for the tonnes and dollar value generated for each natural product, however, countries often provide only one of these variables (and the data provided vary across years). To estimate these missing data, we used country-specific linear models to predict tonnes based on the dollar value of ornamental fish (or, vice versa). For the countries that did not have enough data to develop an adequate model, our models included the data for all the countries within a UN geopolitical region. When there wasn’t enough data at the geopolitical region scale, we used all the global data to predict missing values.

## Risk of harvest practices for ornamental fish 
#### [np_risk_orn](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/np_risk_orn.csv) {-} 

The risk layer is based on whether ornamental fishing has unsustainable harvest practices. Specifically, the intensity of cyanide fishing was used as a proxy. Risk for ornamental fish was set based on assessments of cyanide or dynamite fishing by [Reefs at Risk Revisited](www.wri.org/publication/reefs-at-risk-revisited) [@burke2011reefs] under the assumption that most ornamental fishes are harvested from coral reefs.

## Sea level rise 
#### [cc_slr](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/cc_slr.csv) {-} 

*Pressure*

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: climate change*

The sea level rise pressure layer is derived from satellite altimetry data  ([http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/sea-surface-height-products/global/msla-mean-climatology.html](http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/sea-surface-height-products/global/msla-mean-climatology.html)) [@aviso2024]. Monthly mean sea level anomalies since 1993 track changes in sea level (mm) compared to a reference period from 1993-2012. Raw monthly data are provided on a 0.25x0.25 degree grid. These data were clipped to within 3 nautical miles of the coast, and monthly data layers were aggregated and averaged across pixels to compute mean sea level anomalies. The 99.99th quantile of raster values from all years was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1. All negative values were set to zero (i.e., no negative pressure), such that only positive sea level rise values mattered. The mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.

#### [cc_sst](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/cc_sst.csv) {-}

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: climate change*

Sea surface temperature (SST) data were obtained from the Coral Reef Temperature Anomaly Database (CoRTAD) [@noaa2023], which is produced by the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) using 4.6 km (nominally 21 km^2^ at the equator) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder Version 6 SST data. Weekly SST data are used to compute the standard deviation (SD) of SST's per pixel between 1982 to 2011. We define an anomaly as exceeding the standard deviation of SSTs from the climatology for that location (i.e., grid cell) and week of the year. The frequency of weekly anomalies was calculated for each year in the dataset. We then quantified the difference between the number of anomalies in the 5 most recent years and the 5 baseline years between 1985 and 1989. The 99.99th quantile of raster values from all years was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1, and the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.

Because SST measurements are less reliable where there is persistent ice, we created an ice mask to identify places near the poles that were almost always covered by significant sea ice. The ice mask was generated primarily from the OSI/SAF Global Daily Sea Ice Concentration Reprocessing Data Set, which was regridded and made available in the Pathfinder V5.2 dataset. In Pathfinder, when the OSI/SAF data are unavailable, the sea ice concentrations from the NCDC Daily OI SST data (Reynolds et al. 2007) are included. For each day of the climatological year (1 through 366), we read in the daily sea ice fraction for that day from all of the years and averaged them to create a daily, sea-ice fraction climatology. We then identified grid cells that always contained a sea ice fraction of greater than 0.15 and masked them out of the analysis.

## Seaweed natural product harvest 
#### [np_seaweed_tonnes](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/np_seaweed_tonnes.csv) {-} 

Seaweed mariculture production from the FAO Global Aquaculture Production Quantity dataset [@unitednations2024a]. Only production classified in the "Marine" and "Brackishwater" environments was included in the analysis (all "Freshwater" production was excluded). All non edible seaweed species produced within a country were summed to give a single production value for each country in each year that production took place. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values by summing across these EEZs.

The Social Progress Index ([http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/global-index/](https://www.socialprogress.org/index/global)) [@socialprogressindex2022] includes several quality of life measures.  The SPI score is the average of 3 dimensions, and each dimension is the average of 4 components.  Each component includes several indicators that are scaled from 0 to 100.  When a region was missing 1 or more component, but not all of them, we used the aregImpute function from the Hmisc package to estimate the dimension value based on the available component values.  Regions with no dimension/component data were estimated using a linear regression model with UN geopolitical region and WGI data as predictor variables.  Uninhabited regions received no score.

## Strength of governance 
#### [wgi_all](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/eez/layers/wgi_all.csv) {-} 

*Resilience*

*Category: social*

The Worldwide Governance Indicator [-@worldbank2024wgi] is composed of six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption. These 6 aggregate indicators combine data from a variety of survey institutes, think tanks, NGOs, and international organizations to report on the relative governance of 213 economies worldwide. The WGI combines individual indicators through an Unobserved Components Model to produce the 6 dimensions of governance that range in value from approximately -2.5 to 2.5, have a normal distribution, a mean of zero, and a standard deviation of 1. We take an average of the six dimension scores to produce a single governance score for each country. Social pressure is then calculated as one minus this average WGI score.

WGI scores are provided for China/Hong Kong/Macao and Puerto Rico/Virgin Island, which are combined OHI regions.  These scores were averaged, weighted by population.

Reefs at Risk Revisited [@burke2011reefs] recorded the global presence of destructive artisanal blast fishing based on survey observations and expert opinion. We reclassified the log-scale scoring system for the blast rasters, so 0 = 0, 100 = 1, 1000 = 2. The mean raster score was then determined for each OHI region. The blast values for each region were then summed to get the total.

This data layer describes the pressure on cetaceans and marine turtles for each country calculated using the FAO Global Capture Production Quantity dataset [@united_nations_fao_2025-1]. We extracted all catch records from the FAO data for cetaceans or marine turtles and aggregated to create a total reported catch count for each region. The summed catch was rescaled from 0-1, using the 95th quantile across all years (including and prior to the assessment year) and regions (values > 1 were capped at 1).

The Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) [@wefttdi2021] — successor to the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index — is produced by the World Economic Forum and measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable and resilient development of the Travel and Tourism (T&T) sector, which in turn contributes to the development of a country.” The index is comprised of five subindexes 17 pillars and 112 individual indicators, distributed among the different pillars. The [2021 report](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Travel_Tourism_Development_2021.pdf) included scores ranging from 1-6 for 117 countries. 

To calculate this layer we used scores from the Travel and Tourism Sustainability Subindex which encompasses three pillars: Environmental Sustainability, Socioeconomic Resilience and Conditions, and Travel and Tourism Demand Pressure and Impact. 

For countries not assessed, values were estimated using a linear regression model specific to each UN geopolitical region using per-capita GDP as a predictor variable.

The ultraviolet radiation (UV) pressure layer is derived from daily Local Noon Erythemal UV Irradiance (mW/m^2^) data. The Aura/OMI satellite provides data at 1x1 degree resolution from September 2004 through present, spanning 180 degrees latitude and 360 degrees longitude. Raster data are provided in HDF5 format by the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GESDISC, ([http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omuvbd_v003.shtml](http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omuvbd_v003.shtml)) [@jarihovila2013]. Raw data was downloaded, translated to GeoTIFFs using R and aggregated to weekly means.

This pressure measures the number of times the weekly average of each 1 degree cell exceeds the climatological mean + 1 standard deviation, defined as an anomalous value. The frequency of weekly anomalies was calculated for each year in the dataset. We then quantified the difference between the number of anomalies in the 5 most recent years and the 5 oldest years in the dataset. The 99.99th quantile of raster values from all years was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1, and the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.

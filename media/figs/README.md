! Work in progress!! 

This folder contains (will contain) the figures that the various subpages refer to. 

For example, the regions.qmd file currently contains this inherited file path:

![](../../yearly_results/global2023/Results/figures/maps_by_goal_mol/global_map_Index_2023_mol.png)

which goes to nothing. Instead, it should have the path:

media/figs/name_of_figure.png

where name_of_figure is the name of the figure that the subpage refers to (which we'll need to download from ohi-global)

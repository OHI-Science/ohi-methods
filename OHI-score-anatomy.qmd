We define ocean health as the sustainable delivery of ten widely-held public goals for ocean ecosystems (Table 2.1). These goals represent the full suite of benefits that people want and need from the ocean, including the traditional ‘goods and services’ people often consider (e.g., fish to eat, coastal protection from nearshore habitats) as well as benefits less commonly accounted for, such as cultural values and biodiversity. Within each region, scores, ranging from 0 to 100, are calculated for the 10 goals (section 5.2). Four of the goals are calculated from 2 subgoals. The subgoals are calculated independently (i.e., they are treated as if they are goals) and then combined into the goal status score (Table 2.2).

## 10 Goals of OHI

**Table 2.1. The 10 goals of the Ocean Health Index**

```{r ten_goals, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(xtable)
library(pander)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

goals <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/metadata_documentation/ohi_model/tables/ten_goals.csv") %>%
  select(Goal, Abbreviation, Description) %>%
  arrange(Goal)

kable(goals) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = T)
```

<br/>

## Subgoals

**Table 2.2. Subgoals used to calculate 4 of the Ocean Health Index goals**

```{r subgoals, echo=FALSE}

subgoals <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/metadata_documentation/ohi_model/tables/Subgoal_Descriptions.csv") %>%
  select(Subgoal, Goal, Abbreviation, Description) %>%
  arrange(Goal)

kable(subgoals) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

Goal (and subgoal scores) are calculated using several variables (referred to as “dimensions”, Table 2.3). Goal scores (Section 5.2) are calculated as the average of current status (Section 5) and likely future status. Likely future status (Section 5.3) is the current status modified by variables (resilience, pressures, and trend) expected to influence future status.

## Dimensions

**Table 2.3. Dimension used to calculate an OHI goal score** Goal scores are the average of current and likely future status. Likely future status adjusts current status scores based on pressures and resilience variables acting on the goal as well as recent trends in status.

Finally, an overall Index score for each region is calculated by averaging the goal scores (Figure 2.2).

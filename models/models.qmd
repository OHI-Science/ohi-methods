## Regional and global Index scores

( previously: r child =
'../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/index_scores.Rmd',
eval=index_scores)

The overall index score for each region ($I_{region}$) is calculated as
a weighted average of all the scores ($G$), for each goal ($g$) such
that:

$$
{ I_{region} }\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum_{ g=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ g }{ G }_{ g } }  }{ \displaystyle\sum _{ g=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ g } }  }, (Eq. 5.1) 
$$

where, $w_{g}$ is the weight for each goal.

For the global assessment, the goal weights ($w_{g}$) were assumed to be
equal, even though we know this assumption does not hold for most
individuals or across individuals within communities. Ideally these
weights would be derived empirically, but such an effort would require
surveying a full spectrum of people from every single country. This was
beyond the scope of this project, but may be possible in a future
application of the Index.

In many places certain goals are not relevant, for example,
production-focused goals typically do not apply to uninhabited islands,
and the coastal protection or carbon storage goals will not apply to
regions without the relevant coastal ecosystems.

The overall global index score ($I_{global}$) is calculated as the area
weighted average of the index scores ($I_{region}$) for each region
($i$):

$$
{ I }_{ global }\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { a }_{ i }{ I }_{ region,i } }  }{ \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { a }_{ i } }  }, (Eq. 5.2) 
$$

where, $a_{i}$ is each region's ocean area, based on the EEZ area.

## Goal scores

(previously r child =
'../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/goal_model.Rmd',
eval=goal_model)

Each goal score is the average of its current status and likely future
status (Figure 5.1, see section *5: Goal models and data* for methods
used to calculate status of each goal). The Index assesses the current
status of each goal relative to a reference point. Likely future status
is estimated using: recent trends in current status; pressures that can
stress the system and threaten future delivery of benefits; and
resilience to such pressures, due to governance, institutional and
ecological factors.

**Figure 5.1. Pie chart describing the contribution of each dimension to
the goal score**
![](../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/figures/ScoreDimensionsPieChart.png)

Each goal score, $G$, is the average of its present status, $x$, and its
likely near-term future status, $\hat x_{F}$:

$$
G \quad =\quad \frac {x \quad +\quad \hat x_{F} }{ 2 }, (Eq. 5.3)
$$

The present status of goal, $x$, is its present state, $X$, relative to
a reference point, $X_{R}$, uniquely chosen for each goal:

$$
{ x }_{ i }\quad =\quad \frac { X }{  X_{R} }, (Eq. 5.4) 
$$

The reference point, $X_{R}$, can be determined mechanistically using a
production function (e.g., maximum sustainable yield, MSY, for
fisheries), spatially by means of comparison with another region (e.g.,
country X represents the best possible known case), temporally using a
past benchmark (e.g., historical habitat extent), or in some cases via
known (e.g., zero pollution) or established (e.g., 30% of waters set
aside in MPAs) targets. Past benchmarks can either be a fixed point in
time or a moving target (e.g., five years prior to most current data).
The type of reference point can have important implications for
interpretations of how a goal is doing in any given country.

For each region, the estimate of a goal’s likely near-term future status
is a function of its present status, $x$ modified by: recent trends,
$T$, in status; current cumulative pressures, $p$, acting on the goal;
and social and ecological resilience, $r$, to pressures given the
governance and social institutions in place to protect or regulate the
system and the ecological condition of the system:

$$
\hat {x} _{F} \quad = \quad \left[ 1 \quad + \quad \beta T \quad + \quad \left( 1\quad -\quad \beta  \right) \left( r \quad - \quad  p \right)  \right] x, (Eq. 5.5)
$$

where, $\beta$ represents the relative importance of the trend versus
the resilience and pressure terms in determining the likely trajectory
of the goal status into the future. We assume $\beta = 0.67$, which
makes trend twice as important as the pressure/resilience component. We
chose this value because we believe the direct measure of trend is a
better indicator of future (i.e., in five years) condition than indirect
measures of pressure and resilience.

The role of the resilience and pressure dimensions is to improve our
understanding of the likely near-term future condition by incorporating
additional information beyond that provided by the recent trend.
Pressure or resilience measures that were in existence in the past may
have a cumulative effect that has not yet manifested itself in trend
(e.g., fishing pressure may have increasingly negative impacts as
successive year classes of fish become increasingly less abundant;
resilience due to establishment of a marine protected area (MPA) may
require a number of years before its benefits become apparent). In
addition, the recent trend does not capture the effect of current levels
of resilience and pressures. The expectation of a likely future
condition suggested by the trend will become more or less optimistic
depending on the resilience and pressure dimensions. If the effects are
equal they cancel each other out.

Both resilience and pressure dimensions are scaled from 0 to 1, and
trend is constrained to -1.0 ≤ $T$ ≤ 1.0 (i.e., values outside this
range are clamped to range end values).

The likely future status cannot exceed the maximum possible value of the
status for each goal, which is 1.0. In reality data are rarely perfect,
creating potential situations where likely future condition exceeds 1.0.
To address these cases, we implemented two rules. First, if current
status = 1.0, then trend is set = 0.0, since any trend \> 0.0 in those
cases must be due to incomplete or imperfect data. Second, status and
likely future status scores were constrained to maximum value of 1.

## Likely future status dimensions

Three dimensions are used to calculate likely future status: trends,
pressure, and resilience. This section describes the calculations
underlying these three dimensions.

(previously: r child =
'../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/trend.Rmd', eval=trend)

### Trend

Trend is the proportional change in status predicted to occur in 5
years, based on recent status data. In most cases, this is calculated by
estimating the yearly change in status using a linear regression model
(i.e., slope estimate) of the five most recent years of status data and
multiplying this value by 5 to estimate the change five years into the
future. To determine proportional change, we divide the slope estimate
by the status value of the earliest year of data used in the trend
calculation.

In OHI assessments prior to 2016, we calculated trend as the *absolute*
change in status predicted to occur in 5 years. In 2016, we began
calculating the *proportional* change by dividing the slope estimate by
the status of the earliest year used in the trend calculation. Although
this change rarely had a large effect on trend, or ultimate score
values, this method is more consistent with how trend data is
incorporated into the likely future status model (Eq. 4.5). If the
$\beta$, pressure ($p$), and resilience ($r$) components of the likely
future status model are ignored (this assumes the pressure and
resilience components fully cancel each other out), the equation
becomes:

$x(1 + trend)$,

where, $x$ is the current status. Given this, if $x=50$, and we expect
trend to increase by 10% over 5 years, then likely future status would
be: $50(1 + 0.10) = 55$.

Trends indicate proportional change in status, so they typically range
from -100% to +100% (or, -1.0 to +1.0), therefore we constrained values
to this range.

For all goals we included the trend estimate, even if the linear model
was not statistically significant (i.e., P\<0.05). We chose to include
these values for two key reasons: 1) we were not trying to predict the
future but instead only indicate likely condition. 2) in nearly all
cases we did not have sufficient data to conduct more rigorous trend
analyses.

In some cases, we were not able to estimate trend using status data due
to data limitations. In these cases, we used alternative methods to
estimate trend. Specific details about trend calculations for each goal
are provided in section 5.

We recognize several possible shortcomings in using past trends to
estimate likely future status. We assume a simple linear trend, but this
is not always the case due to a variety of variables such as altered
pressures and resilience responses, nonlinear patterns in system
response, stochastic environmental and biological variability, and
simple bounding conditions (status cannot go below zero or above 1.0,
and so the trend must level off as it approaches these values). Also, it
is important to note that the same trend value could reflect many
different processes. For example, declines due to unsustainable harvest
of a resource can look identical to declines due to restrictions placed
on resource users to allow the resource to recover. It also may be too
short a time frame to determine true trends or the causes of those
trends, but the intent here is more about informing the likely near-term
trajectory.

(r child = '../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/pressure.Rmd',
eval=pressure) \### Pressure

The pressure score, $p$, describes the cumulative pressures acting on a
goal which suppress the goal score. Pressure scores range from 0 to 1,
and they are calculated for each goal and region and include both
ecological ($p_{E}$) and social pressures ($p_{S}$) (Table 5.1, Figure
5.2), such that:

$$
{ p }\quad =\quad \gamma *{ p }_{ E }\quad +\quad (1-\gamma )*{ p }_{ S }, (Eq. 5.6)
$$

where $\gamma$ is the relative weight for ecological vs. social
pressures and equals 0.5 for the global assessment. At global scales,
little evidence exists to support unequal weighting of ecological and
social pressures for most goals; furthermore, unequal weighting would
require unique values for each goal and there is currently no empirical
work to guide such decisions. At local or regional scales there may be
clear evidence for unequal weights per goal and $\gamma$ should be
adjusted accordingly.

**Figure 5.2. Pressure components** Pressure is calculated using both
social and ecological pressures. Ecological pressures include 5
subcategories (fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change,
water pollution, and species/genetic introductions).

data layers used to calculate overall pressure for each goal and region
for the global assessment (descriptions of pressure data in section 6).
Each data layer is assigned to an ecological or social category, and
ecological data are assigned to one of five subcategories.

  left_join(full_lyr_names, by = "layer") %>% 
  mutate(subcategory = gsub("_", " ", subcategory)) %>%
  select(Data = name, "Short name" = layer, Category = category, Subcategory = subcategory, Description = description)

kable(pressure_cat, align = "l")

```

#### Ecological pressure

We assessed five broad, globally-relevant categories of ecological
stressors: fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change
(including ocean acidification), water pollution, and species
introductions (invasive species and genetic escapes). The five
categories are intended to capture known pressures to the
social-ecological system associated with each goal. Each pressure
category may include several stressors. The intensity of each stressor
within each OHI region is scaled from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating the
highest stress (e.g., example of one of these data layers is [sea
surface
temperature](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/layers/cc_sst.csv)).

We determined the rank sensitivity of each goal/subgoal to each stressor
(or, when possible, an element of the goal, such as a specific habitat).
We ranked ecological pressures as having ‘high’ (score = 3), ‘medium’
(score = 2), ‘low’ (score = 1), or 'no' (score = NA) impact (Table 5.2).
Wherever possible we relied on peer-reviewed literature to establish
these rankings, and relied on our collective expert judgment in cases
with no available literature (Table S28 in Halpern et al. 2012). The
pressure ranks are based on a rough estimate of the global average
intensity and frequency of the stressor. We recognize that this will
create over- and under-estimates for different places around the planet,
but to address such variance in a meaningful way would require a
separate weighting matrix for every single region on the planet, which
is not feasible at this time.

**Table 5.2. Pressure matrix** Rank sensitivity of each goal (or, goal
element) to each stressor.

```{r pressure matrix, echo=FALSE}

pressure_matrix <- read.csv(here("eez/conf/pressures_matrix.csv"), na.strings=c("","NA"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(element = ifelse(is.na(element_name), element, element_name)) %>%
  select(-element_name) %>%
  gather("layer", "rank", -(1:2)) %>%
  spread(layer, rank, fill="") %>%
  mutate(element = gsub("_", " ", element))


kable(pressure_matrix, align = "l")

```

To estimate the cumulative effect of the ecological pressures, $P_E$, we
first determined the cumulative pressure, $p$, within each ecological
category, $i$ (e.g., pollution, fishing, etc.):

$$
{ p }_{ i }\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }{ s }_{ i } }  }{ 3 }, (Eq. 5.7)
$$

Where $w_i$ is the sensitivity ranks (Table 5.2) describing the relative
sensitivity of each goal to each stressor, and $s_i$ is intensity of the
stressor in each region on a scale of 0-1. We divided by the maximum
weighted intensity that could be achieved by the worst stressor (max =
3.0).

If $p_i$ \> 1.0, we set the value equal to 1.0. This formulation assumes
that any cumulative pressure load greater than the maximum intensity of
the worst stressor is equivalent to maximum stressor intensity.

For the goals for which sensitivity ranks were assigned for specific
habitats or livelihood sectors (i.e., goal elements), we calculated the
weighted sum of the pressures for only those habitats or sectors that
were present in the country.

The overall ecological pressure, $p_E$, acting on each goal and region
was calculated as the weighted-average of the pressure scores, $p$, for
each category, $i$, with weights set as the maximum rank in each
pressure category ($w_{i\_max}$) for each goal, such that:

$$
{ p }_{ E }\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { (w }_{ i\_ max }*{ p }_{ i }) }  }{ \displaystyle\sum_{ i=1 }^{ N } { { w }_{ i\_ max } }  },  (Eq. 5.8)
$$

Stressors that have no impact drop out rather than being assigned a rank
of zero, which would affect the average score.

#### Social pressures

Social pressures describe the lack of effectiveness of government and
social institutions. Social stressors are described for each region on a
scale of 0 to 1 (with one indicating the highest pressure). Social
pressure is then calculated as the average of the social stressors:

$$
{ p }_{ S }\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ z_{ i } }  }{ N }, (Eq. 5.9)
$$

where $z_{i}$ are the social pressure measures specific to the goal.
Unequal weighting may be appropriate in some cases but is difficult to
assess currently, particularly at the global scale.

#### Caveats

There were a number of ecological pressures not included in our
assessment, including altered sediment regimes, noise and light
pollution, toxic chemicals from point sources, nutrient pollution from
atmospheric deposition and land-based sources other than fertilizer
application to agricultural land. In all cases, global data do not exist
in a format that would allow for adequate comparisons within and among
countries. Future global or regional iterations of the Index could
include these data as they become available.

The calculation of ecological pressures is sensitive to the number of
stressors within each category (but not to the number of categories).
Inclusion of additional stressors within categories would require
careful calibration of ranks so that the cumulative effect of a larger
number of stressors does not overestimate pressure.

A key assumption in our assessment of ecological pressures is that each
goal has a linear and additive response to increases in intensity of the
stressors. Clearly many ecosystems respond non-linearly to increased
stressor intensity, exhibiting threshold responses, and there are likely
nonlinear interactions among stressors. Unfortunately little is known
about the nature of these types of nonlinearities and interactions so we
could not include them in any meaningful way.

(previously: r child =
'../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/resilience.Rmd',
eval=resilience)

### Resilience

To calculate resilience for each goal and region, $r$, we assess three
resilience categories (Table 5.3, Figure 5.3): ecological integrity,
$Y_{E}$, regulatory efforts that address ecological pressures, $Y_R$,
and social integrity, $Y_{S}$. The first two measures address ecological
resilience while the third addresses social resilience. When all three
aspects are relevant to a goal, resilience is calculated as:

$$
r\quad =\quad \gamma *(\frac { { Y }_{ E }+ {Y}_{R} }{ 2 } )+(1-\gamma )*{ Y }_{ S }, (Eq. 5.10)
$$

We chose $\gamma = 0.5$ so the weight of resilience components that
address ecological systems (ecosystem and regulatory) vs. social systems
would be equivalent to the proportions used in the model to calculate
pressure. Resilience indicators are intended to directly address, as
much as possible, specific pressures. Consequently, within a pressure
category, resilience scores should not exceed pressure scores, otherwise
likely future status scores will be inflated. For the 2021 OHI
assessment, in a significant modification from past OHI methods
[@halpern2012index], where total resilience scores were allowed to
exceed total pressures scores, we have capped resilience such that it
will not exceed the corresponding pressures, e.g., $(r−p) ≤ 0$ (i.e.
$r≤p$), when calculating the likely future status for a given goal
[@ohara2020changes].

**Figure 5.3. Resilience components** Resilience includes both
ecological and social resilience categories. Ecological resilience
includes an ecosystem and regulatory category. The regulatory category
includes 5 subcategories that mirror the pressure categories (fishing
pressure, habitat destruction, climate change, water pollution, and
species/genetic introductions) as well as a goal-specific category.

![](../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/figures/ResiliencePieChart.png)

Each resilience category is composed of 1 or more data layers (Table
5.3) with values scaled from 0-1, reflecting the magnitude of
resilience, for each region (an example of one of these data layers
describes [tourism regulations that preserve
biodiversity](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/layers/g_tourism.csv)).
Each resilience data layer is assigned a weight of 0.5 or 1 (Table 5.3)
that is applied equally across all the goals (or, goal elements)
influenced by the resilience layer (i.e., resilience matrix, Table 5.4).
This information is used to calculate a score for each resilience
category. The weight reflects information about governance.

**Table 5.3. Resilience categories and weights** The data layers used to
calculate resilience for each goal and region for the global assessment
(descriptions of data layers and sources are in section 6). Each data
layer is assigned to an ecological or social category. The ecological
category is broken into an ecosystem and regulatory category type.

```{r Resilience categories and weight table, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}

  mutate(subcategory = gsub("_", " ", subcategory)) %>%
  select(Data = name, "Short name" = layer, Category = category, "Category type" = category_type, Subcategory = subcategory, Weight=weight)

kable(res_cat, align = "l")

```

<br/>

**Table 5.4. Resilience matrix** Describes which goals/subgoals (and
goal elements) are influenced by the resilience data layers.

res_matrix <- read.csv(here("eez/conf/resilience_matrix.csv"), na.strings="") 
kable(res_matrix, align = "l")

```

#### Ecological resilience

##### Ecosystem integrity

Ecosystem integrity, e.g., food web integrity, is measured as relative
condition of assessed species in a given location (scores from the
species subgoal were used to estimate ecosystem integrity). For some
goals, there is little evidence that our index of ecosystem integrity
directly affects the value of the goal (or subgoal). In these instances,
ecological integrity falls out of the resilience model.

For the global assessments, we only have one data layer describing
ecosystem integrity, however, if there were multiple layers the overall
score for ecosystem integrity would be a weighted mean of all the data
layers, $i$, that describe ecosystem integrity ($y_{E,i}$) and influence
the goal:

$$
{ Y }_{ E }\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }{ y_E}_{i} }  }{ \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }}}, (Eq. 5.11) 
$$

##### Regulatory resilience

Regulatory resilience ($Y_R$) describes the institutional measures
(e.g., rules, regulations, and laws) designed to address ecological
pressures. The regulatory resilience datasets are grouped into five
categories that address the 5 pressure categories: fishing pressure,
habitat destruction, climate change (including ocean acidification),
water pollution, and species introductions (invasive species and genetic
escapes). There is also an additional category for goal-specific
regulations that apply to a goal or goals, but do not address a larger
pressure category.

Weights were based effectiveness of governance. Governance is a function
of 1) institutional structures that address the intended objective, 2) a
clear process for implementing the institution is in place, and 3)
whether the institution has been effective at meeting stated objectives.
At global scales it is very difficult to assess these three elements; we
usually only had information on whether institutions exist. However, in
some cases we had detailed information on institutions that enabled us
to assess whether they would contribute to effective management, and
thus, increased ocean health. In those latter cases, we gave more weight
to those measures (Table 5.3).

For each region and goal, we calculated a score for each regulatory
category, $y_{R, i}$, as a weighted mean of the resilience data layers,
$r_{i}$, that influence the goal (Table 5.4):

$$
y_{R, i}\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }{ r }_{ i } }  }{ \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{w_i} }, (Eq. 5.12) 
$$

where, $w_i$ is the weight in Table 5.3.

To calculate the overall regulatory resilience, $Y_{R}$, we averaged the
scores for each regulatory category.

#### Social integrity resilience

Social integrity is intended to describe those processes internal to a
community that affect its resilience. It is a function of a wide range
of aspects of social structure. Social Integrity per goal for each
region, $Y_{S}$, is therefore:

$$
 Y_{ S}\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { y }_{ S,i } }  }{ N }, (Eq. 5.13)
 $$

where $y_{S,i}$ are the social integrity measures specific to the goal.

Ideally, assessments of social resilience would include state and
federal level rules and other relevant institutional mechanisms as well.
However, such information is extremely difficult to access for every
single country, and so we relied on global datasets that focus on
international treaties and assessments. Another key gap is information
on social norms and community (and other local-scale) institutions (such
as tenure or use rights) that influence resource use and management in
many settings. Information on these institutions is also extremely
difficult to find at a global scale, although the World Governance
Indicator [@kaufmann2010worldwide] partly measures their effectiveness
through its inclusion of corruption indices.

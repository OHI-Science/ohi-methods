    "text": "One of the first steps of conducting an OHI assessment is defining regions of interest. These can be based on political and/or ecological boundaries. The definition of a “region” varies depending on the goals and scale of the OHI assessment. For the global OHI, each region is defined as the Exclusive Economic Zone boundaries (EEZ, Claus et al. 2012) area (300 nm offshore) for all coastal countries and territories (e.g., US Virgin Islands).\nThere are 220 global coastal countries and territorial regions (Table 4.1). Regions are based on EEZ boundaries. However, we aggregate some EEZ regions to the level of country (e.g., Hawaii is estimated as part of the larger U.S.). We have also modified some boundaries (Halpern et al. 2012, 2015). We do not estimate OHI values for disputed or unclaimed areas.\nFigure 4.1. Global regions Map of the OHI regions (with color corresponding to 2022 regional index scores). Mollweide coordinate reference system is used because it accurately represents area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1.

    "text": "Ocean Health Index 2025: Methods\nThe global Ocean Health Index assesses ocean health for 220 coastal countries and territories and has been conducted every year starting in 2012. The Index describes how well we are sustainably managing 10 goals for ocean ecosystems which represent the full suite of benefits that people want and need from the ocean. These goals include: artisanal fishing opportunity, biodiversity, carbon storage, clean waters, coastal livelihoods and economies, coastal protection, food provision, natural products, sense of place, and tourism and recreation. Each goal is given a score ranging from 0 to 100, and the full suite of goal scores are then averaged to obtain an overall index score for each region.\nFor more information about the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index and model development see Halpern et al. (2012), Halpern et al. (2015), and OHI Global, which includes information about downloading global ocean health data.",

github user content (all layers Rmd) as the second section (it’s extremely long… like super long and could be frustrating for users).\nlook into formatting of long tables in Quarto websites (currently annoying to scroll to the side to read the full width of the long table – see Table 7.1) – floating/hover (not anchored to the bottom) scroll bar (horizontal scroll bar)\nmake a section of which data layers apply to which goals – like Table 7.1, maybe just edit it so Dimension (goal/subgoal) is before description?\nconsider renaming tables (current names not awesome)\ntry reading in the githubuser content (even though it’s super long, could be good to just see what it looks like…)\n\n\n\nSupplemental Methods by Layer\n\n```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE} \n

    "text": "Ideally, regional and local assessments should use the best available data, but this decision limits the ability to compare across scales. For direct comparisons among locations to be valid, they must use consistent data. For this reason, we focused on using global datasets so differences in Index scores across regions are driven by differences in ocean health rather than variation in the data. Although, in reality, many global datasets are compilations of local or regional datasets and their quality varies spatially. In some cases, data for a particular component or dimension of a goal were available for most, but not all, countries. Gaps in these data were known to not be true zero values. Rather than exclude these data layers, we employed several different methods to fill these data gaps (Frazier, Longo, and Halpern 2016).\nThese guidelines both motivated and constrained our methods. The development of the model frameworks for each goal (including reference points) was heavily dictated by the availability of global datasets. And, ultimately, several key elements related to ocean health could not be included due to lack of existing or appropriate global datasets. As new and better data become available in the future, details of how goals or dimensions are modeled will likely change, although the framework we have developed can accommodate these changes.\nFor Index scores to be comparable, every region must have a value for each data layer included in the analysis, unless it is known to not be relevant to a region. In other words, missing data are not acceptable (Burgass et al. 2017). Adhering to this criterion is critical to avoid influencing the Index score simply because of inclusion (or absence) of a particular data layer for any reporting region.\nGaps in data are common; many developing countries lack the resources to gather detailed datasets, and even developed, data-rich countries have inevitable data gaps. We use a variety of methods to estimate missing data, including: averages of closely related groups (e.g., regions sharing ecological, spatial, political attributes; taxonomic groups; etc.), spatial or temporal interpolation (e.g., raster or time-series data), and predictive models (e.g., regression analysis, machine learning, etc.). Gapfilling is a major source of uncertainty, especially for certain goals and regions. Given how common gaps in data are, clear documentation of gapfilling is a critical step of index development because it provides a measure of the reliability of index scores.\nOne of the ongoing goals of the Ocean Health Index (OHI) has been to improve our approach to dealing with missing data, by quantifying the potential influence of gapfilled data on index scores, and developing effective methods of tracking, quantifying, and communicating this information (Frazier, Longo, and Halpern 2016).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBurgass, Michael J., Benjamin S.

    "text": "A comprehensive framework to assess ocean health\nThe Ocean Health Index assesses ocean health which we define as how well we are sustainably managing the resources that we want and need from the ocean (e.g., tourism and recreation, food provisioning).\nThe OHI combines many indicators into a comprehensive framework describing ocean health. This is in contrast to focusing on individual indicators, such as phosphate levels, sedimentation, biodiversity, etc. Individual indicators are important, but they provide limited information when it comes to evaluating how well an overall ecosystem is functioning. They also fail to directly assess what we actually care about in most cases, and consequently, focusing on them can hinder communication. For example, most people do not directly care about nutrient pollution, however, we do care about its effects on the ocean’s ability to provide recreation and food.\nWithout an overall framework to evaluate indicators, certain indicators may be overemphasized relative to their true importance due to researcher bias (most researchers believe their area of study is the most important), trends in research (what is currently considered a hot topic and is funded), and availability of data (e.g., some data is easier to collect). A model that combines multiple indicators will inevitably have flaws, but at least we know which variables are included and how they are weighted.",

    "text": "The role of humans\nOne of the primary contributions of the OHI is that it recognizes people are an important part of the marine system. Both conservation and extractive use of ocean resources are valued, and consequently, scores are highest when we maximize the benefits we receive while maintaining sustainability so we can continue to receive benefits now and into the future. One temptation of indicator development is to focus only on the pressures that humans apply to systems. This makes sense because we want to be sure we are adequately protecting resources. However, eliminating all pressures on the ocean would require eliminating all contact between humans and the ocean. Beyond being unrealistic, this is undesirable because we would stop receiving all the benefits that we rely on from the ocean. The OHI is unique because it tracks both the pressures we put on oceans as well as the benefits we receive.",

    "section": "Yearly assessments",
    "text": "Yearly assessments\nThe global Ocean Health Index has been assessed every year since 2012. The primary goal of each yearly assessment is to calculate a new year of scores using the most recent data. Often, in addition to incorporating an additional year of data, we make improvements to models or decide to use different data sources. To ensure that scores for all years are comparable, we recalculate scores for previous scenario years for each assessment using new methods and data sources. For the current assessment, for example, in addition to calculating the current year’s scores, we recalculate scores for every year since 2012. Consequently, comparisons among years should always be performed using data from the same assessment year so trends in scores reflect changes to ocean health rather than changes to methods.\nNot all data layers are reported through the most current assessment year, and consequently, the OHI scores are calculated using the most recent year of available data.

    "text": "We define ocean health as the sustainable delivery of ten widely-held public goals for ocean ecosystems (Table 2.1). These goals represent the full suite of benefits that people want and need from the ocean, including the traditional ‘goods and services’ people often consider (e.g., fish to eat, coastal protection from nearshore habitats) as well as benefits less commonly accounted for, such as cultural values and biodiversity. Within each region, scores, ranging from 0 to 100, are calculated for the 10 goals (section 5.2). Four of the goals are calculated from 2 subgoals. The subgoals are calculated independently (i.e., they are treated as if they are goals) and then combined into the goal status score (Table 2.2).",

We assigned the stocks to OHI and FAO regions using Free (2017) spatial data describing the range of each stock. When a stock was missing the most recent years of data, carried over the most recent year after 2010 to estimate the missing years.\nWhen RAM data were unavailable, we use the data-limited catch-MSY model (Martell and Froese 2013) to estimate B/Bmsy values using yearly fish catch reconstruction data. For the catch-MSY model, we defined a stock as a species caught within an FAO major fishing area (www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en). This definition of a stock eliminated all taxa not identified to species level. This approach assumes that stocks are defined by FAO region, which we know is often not true because multiple stocks of the same species can exist within an FAO region and some stocks cover multiple FAO regions. However, this assumption is necessary without range maps of stocks. The catch data were summed for each species/FAO region/year, and the catch-MSY model was applied to each stock and FAO region to estimate B/Bmsy.\nWe used SeaLifeBase (Palomares and Pauly 2022) and FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2022) to align taxa names across datasets.\n\n\nUnits\nB/Bmsy",

    "text": "Chemical pollution\n\npo_chemicals\nPressure\nCategory: ecological\nSubcategory: pollution\nThis pressure layer is calculated using modeled data for land-based organic pollution (pesticide data), land-based inorganic pollution (using impermeable surfaces as a proxy), and ocean pollution (shipping and ports). These global data are provided at ~1km resolution, with raster values scaled from 0-1 (Halpern et al. 2008, 2015). To obtain the final pressure values, the three raster layers were summed (with cell values capped at 1).\n\n\nLand-based organic pollution\nData were calculated using modeled plumes of land-based pesticide pollution that provide intensity of pollution at 1km2 resolution (Halpern et al. 2008).\nOrganic pollution was estimated from FAO data on annual country-level pesticide use (http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E) (Nations 2016), measured in metric tons of active ingredients. FAO uses survey methods to measure quantities of pesticides applied to crops and seeds in the agriculture sector, including insecticides, mineral oils, herbicides, fungicides, seed treatments insecticides, seed treatments fungicides, plant growth regulators and rodenticides. Missing values were estimated by regression between fertilizer and pesticides when possible, and when not possible with agricultural GDP as a proxy. Data were summed across all pesticide compounds and reported in metric tons. Upon inspection the data included multiple 0 values that are most likely data gaps in the time-series, so they were treated as such and replaced with NA. In addition, regions with only 1 data point and regions where the most recent data point was prior to 2005 were excluded. Uninhabited countries were assumed to have no pesticide use and thus excluded.\nRegion-level pollution values were then dasymetrically distributed over a region’s landscape using global landcover data from 2009, derived from the MODIS satellite data at ~500m resolution. These values were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~76,000) were aggregated into ~1km Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster.\nThese raw values were then ln(X+1) transformed and normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99.99th quantile of raster values across all years. The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.\n\n\nLand-based inorganic pollution\nThese data are from Halpern et al. (2008, 2015), and available from Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F19021PC, rescaled_2013_inorganic_mol). Non-point source inorganic pollution was modeled with global 1 km2 impervious surface area data http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/ under the assumption that most of this pollution comes from urban runoff. These data will not capture point-sources of pollution or nonpoint sources where paved roads do not exist (e.g., select places in developing countries). Values were aggregated to the watershed and distributed to the pour point (i.e., stream and river mouths) for the watershed with raster statistics (i.e., aggregation by watershed).\n\n\nOcean pollution (shipping lanes, ports)\nThese data are from Halpern et al. (2015), and available from the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1DR2SDD, rescaled_2013_one_ocean_pollution_mol). Ocean-based pollution combines commercial shipping traffic data and port data.\nShipping data was obtained from two sources: (1) Over the past 20 years, 10-20% of the vessel fleet has voluntarily participated in collecting meteorological data for the open ocean, which includes location at the time of measurement, as part of the Volunteer Observing System (VOS). (2) In order to improve maritime safety, in 2002 the International Maritime Organization SOLAS agreement required all vessels over 300 gross tonnage (GT) and vessels carrying passengers to equip Automatic Identification System (AIS) transceivers, which use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to precisely locate vessels.\nPort data was based on the volume (measured in tonnes) of goods transported through commercial ports as a proxy measure of port traffic. Total cargo volume data by port was collected from regional and national statistical organizations, and from published port rankings.\n\n\nUnits\nscaled 0-1",

These values are adjusted by dividing by the GDP of corresponding region/year to control for larger economic trends. National GDP data were obtained from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ NY.GDP.MKTP.CD). For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values using a population-weighted average.\nThis layer includes yearly data for revenue in commercial fishing, aquarium trade fishing, mariculture, marine mammal watching, marine renewable energy, and, tourism. The data sources and methods for each sector are described below.\n\n\nAquarium trade fishing\nTo approximate revenue from aquarium fishing we used export data from the FAO Global Commodities database for ‘Ornamental fish’ for all available years. We used data from two of the four subcategories listed, excluding the subcategory ‘Fish for culture including ova, fingerlings, etc.’ because it is not specific to ornamental fish, and the subcategory ‘Ornamental freshwater fish’ because it is not from marine systems.\n\n\nCommercial fishing\nRevenue data for commercial fishing were obtained from FAO’s FishStat database, which provides yearly dollar values of commercial fisheries production for marine, brackish and freshwater species starting in 1950 and updated yearly. To isolate production values attributable to marine and brackish aquaculture, data pertaining to freshwater species were omitted. This species classification process was very time consuming as each species had to be queried individually per year. Code from emLab was incorporated and adapted to calculate ex-vessel prices for each year beyond 2019.\n\n\nMariculture\nData on revenues from marine aquaculture were derived from FAO’s FishStat database, which includes country-level data on total production values for marine, brackish, and freshwater species beginning in 1984 and updated yearly. To isolate production values attributable to marine and brackish aquaculture, data pertaining to freshwater species were omitted. This species classification process was very time consuming as each species had to be queried individually per year. There was little year-to year variation, and thus data were extracted in 5 year increments, providing data for 1997, 2002 and 2007.\n\n\nMarine mammal watching\nIFAW provides country-level data on total expenditures (including direct and indirect) attributable to the whale watching industry (O’Connor et al. 2009b). Here, total expenditures are used as a close proxy for total revenue. We used total expenditure data (direct and indirect expenditures) to avoid using a literature derived multiplier effect. When IFAW reported “minimal” revenue from whale watching, we converted this description to a 0 for lack of additional information. For countries with both marine and freshwater cetacean viewing, we adjusted by the proportion of marine revenue as described for the jobs dataset.\n\n\nMarine renewable energy\nThe United Nations Energy Statistics Database provides production data, in kilowatt-hours (KWh), for tidal and wave electricity. However, only two countries, France and Canada, have high enough levels of production to be reported in this data source. For Canada, production data were replaced with production data (Gross Megawatt hours per year from 1995-2010) provided directly from the Annapolis tidal power plant because the plant provided a longer time series (Ruth Thorbourne, personal communication, Aug 9, 2011). To convert production data into revenue, production values were multiplied by average yearly prices of electricity per KWh specific to Canada and France, provided by the US Energy Information Administration (http://www.eia.gov/emeu/international/elecprii.html; updated June 2010) after conversion to 2010 USD. Some of the production data could not be used because there were no available electricity price data to convert production into revenue, truncating our time series.\n\n\nTourism\nWTTC reports dollar values of visitor exports (spending by foreign visitors) and domestic travel and tourism spending; combining these two data sets creates a proxy for total travel and tourism revenues. WTTC was chosen as the source for tourism revenue data because of the near-complete country coverage, the yearly time series component starting in 1988 and updated yearly, and the inclusion of both foreign and domestic expenditures. This dataset lumps inland and coastal/marine revenues, and so was adjusted by the percent of a country’s population within a 25 mile inland coastal zone. We included no projected data. We used total contribution to GDP data (rather than direct contribution to GDP) to avoid the use of literature derived multiplier effects.\n\n\nUnits\nstatus 0-100\n## Economic trend scores #### eco_trend {-}\nThis layer provides calculated trend values for the economies subgoal.

Data come from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations (“Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch” 2023). Ten mariculture practice criteria from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch (SFW) Aquaculture Recommendations contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (data quality, effluent, habitat risk, chemical use, feed, escapes, disease, source of stock, predator and wildlife mortalities, and escape of secondary species). The escapes criteria was used for this layer, where a score of 1 is the lowest, and a score of 10 is the highest. The scores reflect the potential impact of genetic escapes on local biodiversity, if these species were to escape. Genetic ‘pollution’ can arise when larvae, spats or seeds escape from poorly managed hatcheries, making native species vulnerable to outbreeding depressions and/or genetic bottlenecks. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw SFW score of 10 and minimum of 1.\nThese scores are country and species-specific, however, many country/species combinations are not assessed by SeaFood Watch. Given that each mariculture record must have a corresponding escapes score we used a series of steps to estimate escapes scores for every country and species. If a country/species match was available we used that, otherwise, we gapfilled using the following sequence:\n\nUsed the global species value provided by SeaFood Watch\nWithin a country, used average of species within the same family\nWithin a UN geo-political region, used average of species within the same family\nGlobal, use average of species within the same family\nGlobal, use average of species within a broad taxonomic grouping (e.g., crustaceans, algae, bivalves, etc.)\nFinally, if these scores were not available for the categories above, we used the global average of all species.\n\nSeaweed or algae species were given the global seaweed escapes score provided by the Seafood Watch recommendations. We are aware that there is some bias associated with using scores derived as averages across countries because they were originally assigned to specific species-country pairs, nevertheless this is preferable to applying an escapes score solely based on a subset of the species harvested.\n\n\nUnits\nscaled 0-1",

This layer was developed from a machine learning model that utilizes remote sensing data, as well as data from benthic and geomorphic surveys, specifically designed to include deeper reef structures, steep reef slope area, and reef tracts in turbid water that can be difficult to survey. Further information on sampling and labeling methodology can be found here.\nArea cells were intersected with the EEZ boundaries, to determine total reef extent by country. Countries for which no extent data was available were gapfilled with previous year’s methodology, were coral condition was calculated using current condition data divided by reference condition.\nThis process used condition data from percent live coral cover from 12,634 surveys from 1975-2006 (Bruno and Selig 2007; Schutte, Selig, and Bruno 2010). When multiple data points were available for the same site and year, we averaged these data, and also averaged the site data to calculate a per country per year average. However, data were missing for several countries and some countries did not have data for the reference or current year time periods or had only 1-2 surveys. Because coral cover can be highly temporally and spatially dynamic, having only a few surveys that may have been motivated by different reasons (i.e., documenting a pristine or an impacted habitat) can bias results. To calculate condition we used fitted values from a linear trend of all data per country, which was more robust to data poor situations and allowed us to take advantage of periods of intense sampling that did not always include both current and reference years. Then, we created a fitted linear model of all these data points from 1975-2010, provided that 2 or more points are in 1980-1995 and 2 or more points are in 2000-2010. We defined the ‘current’ condition (health) as the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010, and the reference condition as the mean of the predicted values for 1985-1987. Where country data were not available, we used an average from adjacent EEZs weighted by habitat area, or a georegional average weighted by habitat area, based on countries within the same ocean basin (Figure 7.1).\nFigure 7.1.

Regionally specific IUCN risk category data for subpopulations are included where available. Trend calculations are based on the change in each species’ IUCN risk category over time, based upon past and current IUCN assessments.\nOHI defines iconic species as those relevant to local cultural identity through the species’ relationship to traditional activities such as fishing, hunting, commerce or involvement in local ethnic or religious practices; and species with locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common artistic subjects such as whales). Habitat forming species are excluded in this definition of iconic species. The OHI global iconic species list combines three species lists from WWF Global: global priorities, regional and local priorities, and flagship species. It also incorporates culturally important species (Reyes-García et al. 2023). The criteria for including species on these lists are consistent with the OHI’s definition of iconic species.\nOnce the species lists were obtained, each species was assigned to a region based on native range countries from the IUCN Red List.\nMost of the iconic species are not region specific, and the global list is applied across all regions. However, some countries have developed national priority and flagship species lists in conjunction with WWF. These region-specific iconic species lists supplement the global list for those specific countries only. In addition, as countries and regions conduct OHI regional assessments, we will use the iconic species list developed by those countries/regions to supplement our global model. For example, iconic species identified for the Baltic Health Index regional assessment have been included for all countries bordering the Baltic Sea. Additional culturally important species were added to supplement the original iconic species list (Reyes-García et al. 2023). These culturally important species are listed as iconic at the continent level. Species are considered iconic for all regions where they are present within the continent they are listed.\nTable 7.5.

    "text": "Livelihood status scores\n\nliv_status\nThis layer provides calculated status values for the livelihoods subgoal. Livelihoods is calculated using job and wage data from marine sectors.\nNote: These data are no longer supported. Consequently, this layer was last updated in 2013, and this goal will no longer be updated with these data.\nLivelihoods status is generally calculated as: (cur_base_value / ref_base_value) / (cur_adj_value / ref_adj_value)\nWhere, cur_base_value is the most recent value (i.e., jobs or wages) for each sector/region, and ref_base_value is the value for the earliest year of data for each sector/region. These values are adjusted to control for larger trends within the region. For example, jobs data for the livelihoods subgoal was adjusted by dividing by the percent employment of the corresponding year. For wage data, the adjustment was done a bit differently by multiplying wages by GDPpcPPP for each year/region to make wages comparable.\n\n\nJobs\nJobs includes yearly data for commercial fishing, mariculture, marine mammal watching, marine renewable energy, and, tourism. The data sources and methods for each sector are described below.\nPercent employment during the current status year for each sector/region is calculated as (1 - percent unemployment)*total labor force (World Bank). Jobs data for the livelihoods subgoal were adjusted by dividing by the percent employment in the corresponding year.\n\nCommercial fishing\nData are from the OECD (Employment in fisheries, aquaculture, and processing, 2009-2021) (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2025a). The data are filtered for the number of people working in the marine and subsistence fishing sectors. The OECD data are supplemented with additional data from the table on pg. 169 of the FAO Yearbook 2021 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2024) and ILOSTAT for “Rev 3.1.B: Fishing” (International Labour Organization 2025b).\n\n\nMariculture\nData are from the OECD (Employment in fisheries, aquaculture, and processing, 2009-2021) (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2025b). The data are filtered for “People employed in aquaculture sector.” The OECD data are supplemented with additional data from the table on pg. 170 of the FAO Yearbook 2021 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2024)\n\n\nMarine mammal watching\nThe International Fund for Animal Welfare’s (IFAW) Whale Division provides time series data on whale watching in more than 115 coastal countries (O’Connor et al. 2009b). This dataset may be an imperfect representation of all marine mammal watching due to its focus on whales, although it does include data for other types of marine mammal watching (e.g., dolphins). However, to our knowledge, it is the most complete dataset pertaining to the global marine mammal watching industry. We obtained regional averages of the number of whale watchers per employee, as well as the number of whale watchers in each country. Using this information, we estimated the number of whale watching jobs in each country by dividing the country’s total number of whale watchers by the average number of whale watchers per employee for that country’s region (e.g., Africa & Middle East, Europe, North America). It is important to note that data are not annual, but there are at least four years of data for each country. When IFAW reported “minimal” numbers of whale watchers, we converted this description to a 0 for lack of additional information. Because some of the whale watching in O’Connor et al. focused on freshwater cetacean viewing, we categorized the target species listed for each country as freshwater or marine. For countries with both marine and freshwater species, we categorized the whale watching in those countries as either 50% or 90% marine, based on the number of marine versus freshwater target species and information provided in the report narrative. For Colombia and Indonesia, more detailed information in the report narrative allowed for a more precise determination of the percentage of marine-based whale watching. We applied these marine proportions to data on the number of whale watchers before converting these estimates into employment estimates.\n\n\nMarine renewable energy\nThe number of marine renewable energy jobs was determined for the two countries, France and Canada, which produce significant enough amounts of tidal energy to register with the UN Energy Statistics Database. For the La Rance plant in France, employment information was obtained from a recent press statement (EDF 2011); we assumed employment stayed constant over the time period for which we had production data for this plant, given relatively consistent or even growing production. For the Annopolis Royal plant in Canada, we received yearly employment information from the plant (Ruth Thorbourne, personal communication, Aug 9 2011).\nMarine renewable energy includes five major technologies: tidal barrages, marine currents, waves, ocean thermal converters and salinity gradients. However, we only include data for the largest tidal barrage plants, as these data are available.\n\n\nTourism\nThe World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) provides data on travel and tourism’s total contribution to employment for 180 countries. Although other global data sources on tourism are available (i.e., United Nations World Tourism Organization, UNTWO), the WTTC database was chosen because it offers yearly time series data that span through the current year, it includes nearly complete coverage of all nations, and it disaggregates direct and total (direct plus indirect) employment impacts of tourism. WTTC provides projected data, however, we do not use these values. We used total employment data to avoid the use of literature derived multiplier effects. The WTTC shares a significant drawback with UNTWO data, in that data on coastal/marine and inland tourism are lumped. Therefore, a country-specific coefficient must be applied to estimate the jobs provided by coastal/marine tourism alone. We adjusted national tourism data by the proportion of a country’s population that lives within a 25 mile inland coastal zone.\n\n\n\nWages\nWages were multiplied by GDPpcPPP for each country/year to make values comparable.\nWe used the Occupational Wages around the World (OWW) database produced by Remco H. Oostendorp and Richard B. Freeman in 2005. These data were drawn from the International Labour Organization and subjected to a standardization process (for more information, see http://www.nber.org/oww/Technical _document_1983-2003_standardizationv3.pdf). The database provides several different calibrations, and we use the “x3wl calibration”, described as a “country-specific and uniform calibration with lexicographic weighting,” and recommended as being the preferred calibration in most cases. Although significant gaps exist in this database, it contains country-specific information on average wages in many industries for more than 150 countries from 1983-2003. Data represent average monthly wages of a male worker. Wage data were divided by the inflation conversion factor for 2010 so that wage data across years would be comparable (http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr), and then multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita gdp (ppppcgdp, WorldBank). The adjusted wage data were then multiplied by 12 to get annual wages. We used the industry and occupation classifications reported in the OWW to estimate wages for marine-related sectors.\nTable 7.6. Occupation classification for wage data sectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector\nOccupation classifications\n\n\n\n\nCommercial fishing\nIndustry: deep sea & coastal fishing; Occupations: deep sea fisher; inshore (coastal) maritime fisherman\n\n\nPorts & harbors\nIndustry: supporting services to maritime transport;  Occupation: dock worker\n\n\nShip & boat building\nIndustry: shipbuilding and repairing;  Occupation: ship plater\n\n\nTourism\nIndustry: restaurants and hotels;  Occupations: hotel receptionist; cook; waiter; room attendant or chambermaid.

    "text": "Mariculture sustainability score\n\nmar_sustainability_score\nTen mariculture practice criteria from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations (“Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch” 2023) contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (data quality, effluent, habitat risk, chemical use, feed, escapes, disease, source of stock, predator and wildlife mortalities, and escape of secondary species). These criteria represent the internal mariculture practices with the potential to affect the long term sustainability of the mariculture system. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum raw Seafood Watch score and minimum of 0, under the assumption that the highest score is the best possible given current technologies.\nThese scores are country and species-specific, however, many country/species combinations are not assessed by Seafood Watch. Given that each mariculture record must have a corresponding sustainability score we used a series of steps to estimate sustainability scores for every country and species. If a country/species match was available we used that, otherwise, we gapfilled using the following sequence: 1. Used the global species value provided by SeaFood Watch 2. Within a country, used average of species within the same family 3. Within a UN geo-political region, used average of species within the same family 4. Global, use average of species within the same family 5. Global, use average of species within a broad taxonomic grouping (e.g., crustaceans, algae, bivalves, etc.) 6. Finally, if these scores were not available for the categories above, we used the global average of all species.\nSeaweed or algae species were given the global seaweed sustainability score provided by the Seafood Watch recommendations. We are aware that there is some bias associated with using scores derived as averages across countries because they were originally assigned to specific species-country pairs, nevertheless this is preferable to applying a sustainability score solely based on a subset of the species harvested.\nTable 7.8. Mariculture sustainability criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nDescription of practice and score scheme\n\n\n\n\nData\nPoor data quality and availability limits the ability to assess and understand the impacts of aquaculture production. It also does not enable informed choices for seafood purchasers or enable businesses to be held accountable for their impacts. A score between 1 and 10 was given based on data availability, quality, and confidence.\n\n\nEffluent\nAquaculture species, production systems and management methods vary in the amount of waste produced per unit of production. The combined discharge of farms, groups of farms or industries contribute to local and regional nutrient loads. A score of 1 to 10 is given based on the concern of the effluent produced from the practices.\n\n\nHabitats\nAquaculture farms can be located in a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitat types and have greatly varying levels of impact to both pristine and previously modified habitats as well as to the critical “ecosystem services” they provide. Scores are based on whether they are located at sites, scales and intensities that maintain the functionality of ecologically valuable habitats.\n\n\nChemical use\nImproper use of chemical treatments impacts non-target organisms and leads to production losses and human health concerns due to the development of chemical-resistant organisms. Scores are based on if facilities limit the type, frequency of use, total use, or discharge of chemicals to levels representing a low risk of impact to non-target organisms.\n\n\nFeed\nFeed consumption, feed type, ingredients used and the net nutritional gains or losses vary dramatically between farmed species and production systems. Producing feeds and their ingredients has complex global ecological impacts, and the efficiency of conversion can result in net food gains or dramatic net losses of nutrients. Feed use is considered to be one of the defining factors of aquaculture sustainability. Scores are based on whether facilities source sustainable feed ingredients and convert them efficiently with net edible nutrition gains.\n\n\nEscapes\nCompetition, altered genetic composition, predation, habitat damage, spawning disruption, and other impacts on wild fish and ecosystems resulting from the escape of native, non-native and/or genetically distinct fish or other unintended species from aquaculture operations. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to wild species or other ecosystem-level impacts from farm escapes.\n\n\nDisease, pathogen and parasite interaction\nAmplification of local pathogens and parasites on fish farms and their transmission or retransmission to local wild species that share the same water body. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to wild species through the amplification and retransmission, or increased virulence of pathogens or parasites.\n\n\nSource of stock\nThe removal of fish from wild populations for growing to harvest size in farms. Scores are based on whether facilities use eggs, larvae, or juvenile fish produced from farm-raised broodstocks thereby avoiding the need for wild capture.\n\n\nPredator and wildlife mortalities\nMortality of predators or other wildlife caused or contributed to by farming operations. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to predators or other species of wildlife attracted to farm sites.\n\n\nEscape of secondary species\nMovement of live animals resulting in introduction of unintended species. Scores are based on whether facilities avoid the potential for the accidental introduction of secondary species or pathogens resulting from the shipment of animals.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnits\nscaled 0-1",

These data report the number and type of introduced and invasive species for each country, with species habitat listed under marine, brackish, freshwater, terrestrial, or some combination thereof. We only select species listed as marine or brackish, including those which are listed in combination with other habitat types (typically birds, plants, and insects which intersect multiple habitats). For our purposes, a weighted average of invasive species (90%) and introduced species (10%) were used to calculate the score. This split was made to account for unreliable data on the harm caused by introduced species, especially in marine environments, and to capture data inaccuracies in the overall dataset from reporting on the distinction between introduced and invasive species from individual countries. OHI regions with no data reported are gapfilled with regional averages. All values are rescaled to between 0 and 1.\n\\[\nPressure = 0.1 * \\frac{S_n - min(S_n)}{max(S_n) - min(S_n)} + 0.9 * \\frac{S_h - min(S_h)}{max(S_h) - min(S_h)}\n\\]\nWhere,\n\\(S_n\\) = number of introduced (naturalized) species in the region.\n\\(min(S_n)\\) = the minimum number of introduced (naturalized) species in all regions.\n\\(max(S_n)\\) = the maximum number of introduced (naturalized) species in all regions.\n\\(S_h\\) = number of invasive (harmful) species in the region.\n\\(min(S_h)\\) = the minimum number of invasive (harmful) species in all regions.\n\\(max(S_h)\\) = the maximum number of invasive (harmful) species in all regions.\nPredicting the full potential impact of alien species depends in large part on having high-resolution spatial information on where they exist, how far they have spread and exactly which components of the food web they affect. The data from (Pagad et al. 2018) approximate these impacts but at country scales. In addition, the impacts of introduced and invasive species will vary depending on the goal under consideration. This implies that harmful effects would need to be assessed separately for each goal. Such an endeavor may be possible when applying this framework to a smaller case-study where this type of information can be acquired.\n\n\nUnits\nscaled 0-1",

To disaggregate national fertilizer application at the crop-level, we compiled fertilizer use by crop (FUBC) rates from the International Fertilizer Association’s (IFA) FUBC series (FAO/IFA/IFDC 2002; Heffer, Gruere, and Roberts 2017), FUBC rates provided by request. The FUBC series provides national application rates, measured in kilograms per hectare, of N, P2O5, and K2O for all crop categories. FUBC rates for 2014/15 were extracted from Heffer et al. (2017) (FUBC rates provided by request), and harmonised with general crop categories, with the exception of fodder, which is not included, and the residual category, which combines crop categories from our study that are unlikely to have similar fertilizer application rates. hence, we extracted FUBC rates for these remaining crop categories and fodder by extracting crop-specific FUBC rates from FAO (2002). While these rates are more specific at the national and crop level, they were reported between 1996-2001, which is relatively old compared to FUBC rates for 2014/15. To gapfill missing national rates for FUBC 2002, we used the mean fertilizer rate using the smallest regional mean or adopting the next largest regional mean if the smaller region had no data (“UNSD — Methodology” 2020). We also allocated national fertilizer use to grasslands using 2014/15 FUBC percentages.\nTo determine the proportion of fertilizer allocated by country, crop, production system, and fertilizer, we multiplied crop-specific rates by the total national harvested area of each crop and production system calculated from SPAM harvested area maps (production maps taken from Halpern et al. (2022), in review). Because the SPAM harvested area maps are only from data year 2017, the location of fertilizer use does not change across years, only relative intensity does. Fertilizer inputs to irrigated high input production systems were weighted two times higher than high-input rain-fed production systems for the same production (FAO 2005), while the two other production systems (low input and subsistence) were assigned a weight of zero as they do not require fertilizer use. The proportion of nutrient applied was calculated for each country, crop, production system, and fertilizer. We disaggregated national fertilizer application by multiplying national fertilizer with the proportions. We disaggregated national fertilizer input at the raster level by multiplying the cell-level proportion of harvested area in the country for each crop and production system with the national fertilizer use.\nCalculating excess nitrogen from synthetic fertilizer applied to crops\nExcess nutrients from crops were estimated using the proportion of N that is leached, and the proportion of N that is volatilised as NH3. We define excess nitrogen, \\(N_{excess}\\), as the tonnes of applied nitrogen that likely runsoffs/leaches, Nleach, or volatilizes as NH3, \\(N_{{vol}_{NH3}}\\), which is subsequently deposited on land and water:\n\\(N_{excess} = N_{{vol}_{NH3}} + N_{leach}\\)\nwhere,\n\\(N_{leach} = N_{applied} – N_{withdrawal} –  N_{nitrification/denitrification} – N_{{vol}_{NH3}}\\)\n\\(N_{withdrawal}\\) = estimates of withdrawal of N by plants on both crops and grazed areas at supernational scale (NUE values from A. F. Bouwman, Van Drecht, and Van der Hoek (2005)).\n\\(N_{nitrification/denitrification}\\) = estimate of N emissions through nitrification/denitrification processes (e.g., N20, NO, N2), with a global estimate of 10.2% used (A. F. Bouwman, Boumans, and Batjes 2002; Scheer et al. 2020).\n\\(N_{{vol}_{NH3}}\\) = estimates of N volatilization as NH3 at supernational scale (A. Bouwman, Boumans, and Batjes (2002), Table 5 summed grasslands, crops, wetland rice).\nCalculating excess nitrogen from livestock manure pathways\nWe estimated for four general manure pathways (managed then spread, spread on soil, spread on pasture, left on pasture) the proportion of excreted N (United Nations 2021) that is removed by plants, volatilizes as NH3, is converted to NOx products during nitrification/denitrification, or, is lost through leaching or runoff (Fig. 7.2).\nFigure 7.2. Nitrogen leaching and volatilization from manure pathways.  For manure applied to crop soils or pastures or left on pastures, we generally estimated the proportion of N that runs off or leaches, \\(PN_{leach}\\), as:\n\\(PN_{leach} = 1 – PN_{withdrawal} – PN_{nitrification/denitrification} – PN_{vol_{NH3}}\\)\nwhere the values vary according to the manure pathway (Table 7.9).\nTable 7.9.

The proportion of N leaching from manure management systems, \\(PMMS_{leach}\\), was calculated using a modified version of GLEAM equation 4.4.4 (FAO 2018):\n\\(PMMS_{leach} = ∑_s (MS_s  × F_{leach,s}  × (1 - ex_{vol}))\\)\n\\(MMS_{leach}\\) = proportion N leached for managed manure for animal system\n\\(MS_s\\) = Fraction of manure treated in each system, s (FAO 2018)\n\\(F_{leach,s}\\) = Fraction N leached in each manure management system (FAO 2018)\n\\(ex_{vol}\\) = Fraction N volatilized after excretion, used global value of 0.0075 (FAO 2018)\nTo determine the proportion of N volatilizing as NH3 for manure treated in a manure management system, we determined the total proportion of all N lost during management (Table 10.23 in Gavrilova and et al. (2019)). Nitrogen loss includes runoff/leaching, volatilization of NH3, and NOx from denitrification/nitrification. We subtracted the proportion expected to leach in each manure management system (FAO 2018). The remaining loss included both NH3 volatilization and NOx from nitrification/denitrification, so we used an adjustment factor of 0.74 to account for only NH3 volatilization of N, based on the proportion of NH3/(NH3 + NOx) observed in directly applied manure.\nEventually, the managed manure is typically applied to either crop soils or pasture soils. Using the same assumption as A. F. Bouwman, Beusen, and Billen (2009), in industrialized countries we applied 50% of manure to pastures and 50% to crops, and in developing countries we applied 95% to crop land and 5% to pastures.\nNext, for each livestock system and country, we estimated the total proportion of N that runsoffs/leaches, \\(PN_{leach}\\), or volatilizes as NH3, \\(PN_{NH3}\\) based on the proportion of manure, \\(P_{manure}\\), that enters each manure pathway for a given livestock system and country (FAO (2018), Figure 7.2):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n               PN_{leach} = P_{manure}  \\times PMMS_{leach} + \\\\\n               P_{manure}  \\times PAppliedCrops_{leach} + \\\\\n               P_{manure}  \\times PAppliedPastures_{leach} + \\\\\nP_{manure}  \\times PLeftPastures_{leach}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe estimated \\(PN_{NH3}\\) similarly.\nFor each livestock system, we then mapped the yearly tonnes of N that leaches or runsoff from manure, \\(rastTN_{leach}\\):\n\\(rastTN_{leach} = rastPN_{leach} \\times rastN_{ex} \\times rastN_{animals}\\)\nwhere,\n\\(rastPN_{leach}\\) = rasterized data describing total proportion of N runoff/leaching for a specific animal system and country\n\\(rastN_{ex}\\) = raster describing annual N excretion, tonnes N animal-1 year-1 (country and animal specific values from United Nations (2021))\n\\(rastN_{animals}\\) = raster data describing number of animals for an animal system (FAO 2018)\nWe similarly mapped the total tonnes of N that volatilizes as NH3.\nN leaching and N volatilization from synthetic fertilizers applied to grassland\nWe calculated national agricultural grassland fertilizer input by multiplying the national agricultural fertilizer input with the percentage of fertilizer allocated to grasslands nationally in 2014/15 (Heffer, Gruere, and Roberts 2017). We assumed all agricultural grassland fertilizer input was used on grass fed to livestock. To spatially disaggregate national fertilizer input, we multiplied national fertilizer input by the proportion of livestock units (LSU) for each country, animal and product (milk, meat, etc.) at the cell-level.\nTo calculate excess nutrients from synthetic fertilizers applied to grasslands, we estimated the proportion of N that is leached, and the proportion of N that is volatilized as NH3 (Figure 7.2). Methods are the same as manure pathways, with the exception of using grassland-specific proportions to calculate \\(N_{{vol}_{NH3}}\\) (A. Bouwman, Boumans, and Batjes 2002).\nPluming excess nitrogen to coastal areas\nFinal excess nitrogen layers from crop fertilizer and livestock manure were then combined together to create rasters describing excess nitrogen leaching at 0.5 degree gridded resolution and excess nitrogen volatilization at 0.5 degree gridded resolution. To estimate the amount of leached nitrogen which reaches coastal systems we assumed that any nitrogen which was more than 1km away from surface waters and coastlines would not contribute to effluent totals. To estimate the amount of volatilized nitrogen which reaches coastal systems, we multiplied yearly volatilized raster by a raster describing proportion of area within cells that are surface waters and cells that are 1km away from the coast. This was done under the assumption that all leaching and volatilization would not reach coastal areas due to uptake from soils and other processes. Surface water rasters were provided upon request from Tuholske (2021). Following this, we combined the coastal leaching and coastal volatilization rasters into single, yearly pollution rasters.\nThese yearly pollution rasters were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~95,000 were aggregated into 0.5 degree gridded Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster for each year from 2005 to 2020.\nThese raw values were then normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99th quantile of raster values across all years. The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.\n\n\nUnits\nscaled 0-1",

We define an anomaly as exceeding the standard deviation of SSTs from the climatology for that location (i.e., grid cell) and week of the year.

    "section": "Artisanal opportunities",
    "text": "Artisanal opportunities\nArtisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations (Allison and Ellis 2001). Artisanal fishing refers to fisheries involving households, cooperatives or small firms (as opposed to large, commercial companies) that use relatively small amounts of capital and energy and small fishing vessels (if any), make relatively short fishing trips, and use fish mainly for local consumption or trade. These traits differ from commercial scale fisheries that serve the global fish trade, and commercial and artisanal scale fisheries also differ in how they are valued by many communities around the world.\nArtisanal fisheries contribute over half of the world’s marine and inland fish catch, nearly all of which is used for direct human consumption (Nations 2010). They employ over 90 percent of the world’s more than 35 million capture fishers and support another approximate 90 million people employed in jobs associated with fish processing, distribution and marketing (Nations 2010). Artisanal fisheries also are distinguished by the role they play in shaping and sustaining human cultures around the world; this role contributes to their distinct value (McGoodwin 2001). For this reason, we designate artisanal fishing opportunities as a distinct public goal. In some countries like the U.S.A., artisanal fishing may happen under a commercial license (e.g., a family run lobster boat or individual shellfish harvesting permit), or under a recreational fishing permit (e.g., families fishing with rods for fish to eat); the food provided by these activities should ideally be captured under the food provision goal, whereas the opportunity to pursue artisanal fishing is captured here. The goal is not about recreational fishing for sport, which is captured in food provision (if it provides food) and tourism and recreation.\nThe livelihood and household economy provided by fishing are considered part of the coastal livelihoods and economies goal, although similar to food provision from artisanal fishing it is currently impossible to measure on a global scale. Our focus is on the opportunity to conduct this kind of fishing. What is intended by the idea of ‘opportunity’ is the ability to conduct sustainable artisanal-scale fishing when the need is present, rather than the actual amount of catch or household revenue that is generated. Although this may seem nuanced on the value and intent of artisanal fishing, the opportunity to conduct this fishing is clearly of great importance to many people (McGoodwin 2001). Status for this goal is a function of need for artisanal fishing opportunities and whether or not the opportunity is permitted and/or encouraged institutionally and done sustainability. This need could potentially be driven by any number of socio-economic factors, but perhaps the simplest and most directly tied to this need is the percent of the population that is below the poverty level. Data on how many people live below the poverty level are not available for many countries. Therefore, we used an analogous proxy that is more complete globally: per capita gross domestic product (pcGDP) adjusted by the purchasing power parity (PPP). This metric translates the average annual income (pcGDP) into its local value (PPP). These data correlate with UN data on the percent of a population living below the $2/day international poverty standard (linear: R2 = 0.61, p &lt;0.001; logarithmic regression: R2 = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001). Because the relationship is a better fit with the ln-linear regression, we ln-transform the PPPpcGDP scores.\n\nCurrent status\nStatus for this goal (\\(x_{ao}\\)) is therefore measured by unmet demand (\\(D_u\\)), which includes measures of opportunity for artisanal fishing (\\(O_{ao}\\), defined below) and the sustainability of the methods used (\\(S_{ao}\\)):\n\\[\nx_{ao} = (1 – D_u) * S_{ao}, (Eq. 6.1)\n\\]\nwhere \\(S_{ao}\\) indicates whether artisanal fishing is done in a sustainable manner. This was approximated using Sea Around Us Project (SAUP) (D. Pauly, Zeller, and Palomareas 2020) global marine fisheries catch data (Daniel Pauly and Zeller 2016) and B/Bmsy data (Ricard et al. 2012; C. Costello et al. 2012; Martell and Froese 2013; Thorson et al. 2013; Rosenberg et al. 2014; Christopher Costello et al. 2016; RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database 2025) calculated from our fisheries sub-goal (methods can be found in section 6.6.1), and subsetted for artisanal and subsistence stocks notated in the SAUP data. And, \\(D_u\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nD_{u} = (1 – PPPpcGDP) * (1 – O_{ao}), (Eq. 6.2)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(PPPpcGDP\\) is the ln-transformed, rescaled purchasing power parity adjusted per capita GDP, and \\(O_{ao}\\) is the access to artisanal-scale fishing determined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) 14.b.1 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2023).\nWe rescaled the ln-transformed \\(PPPpcGDP\\) values from 0-1 by dividing by the value corresponding to the 99th quantile across all regions and years from 2005 to 2015 (values &gt; 1 were capped at 1). Developed countries with lower demand for artisanal scale fishing (i.e., low poverty indicated by high PPPpcGDP) score high, regardless of the opportunity made available (since it would not matter to many), and developing countries with high demand and opportunity would also score high.\nTo assess the opportunity or ability to meet this demand, \\(O_{ao}\\), we used data from UN SDG 14.b.1 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2023), which scores countries on the institutional measures that support or protect access to artisanal and small-scale fishing. The data come are FAO member country responses to the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) (Table 6.1) survey questionnaire which is circulated by FAO every two years to members and IGOs and INGOs and are on a scale from 0 to 1.\nThe sustainability of artisanal fishing practices was estimated by subsetting for artisanal and subsistence stock B/Bmsy values which were calculated in our fisheries sub-goal (section 6.6.1).\nSeveral issues and datasets relevant to artisanal fishing opportunities were not included in our calculations for a number of reasons. High unemployment can lead to a greater demand for artisanal fishing opportunities (Cinner, Daw, and McCLANAHAN 2009), but unemployment is not a good measure of potential ‘demand’ for most developing countries since many people not working do not get recorded in unemployment statistics, even though it may be relevant for developed countries. Regardless, it is very difficult to set an arbitrary cut-off for developing versus developed countries, and so there is no clear way to use unemployment data for this goal.\nTable 6.1.

    "section": "Biodiversity",
    "text": "Biodiversity\nPeople value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, this goal assesses the conservation status of species based on the best available global data through two sub-goals: species and habitats. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. Because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, we also assessed habitats as part of this goal, and considered them a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them. For the species sub-goal, we used species risk assessments from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2024) for a wide range of taxa to provide a geographic snapshot of how total marine biodiversity is faring, even though it is a very small sub-sample of overall species diversity (Mora et al. 2011). We calculate each of these subgoals separately and weight them equally when calculating the overall goal score.\n\nHabitat (subgoal of biodiversity)\nThe habitat subgoal measures the average condition of marine habitats present in each region that provide critical habitat for a broad range of species (mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, kelp forests, salt marshes, sea ice edge, tidal flats, and subtidal soft bottom). This subgoal is considered a proxy for the condition of the broad suite of marine species.\nData availability remains a major challenge for species and habitat assessments. We compiled and analyzed the best available data in both cases, but key gaps remain. Although several efforts have been made in recent years to create or compile the data necessary to look at the status and trends of marine habitats, most efforts are still hampered by limited geographical and temporal sampling (Joppa et al. 2016), although sea ice DiGirolamo et al. (2022) data is an exception. In addition, most marine habitats have only been monitored since the late 1970s at the earliest, many sites were only sampled over a short period of time, and very few sites were monitored before the late 1990s so establishing reference points was difficult. Salt marshes, kelp forests, and seagrasses were the most data-limited of the habitats included in the analysis.\n\nCurrent status\nThe status of the habitat sub-goal, \\(x_{hab}\\), was assessed as the average of the condition estimates, \\(C\\), for each habitat, \\(k\\), present in a region; measured as the loss of habitat and/or % degradation of remaining habitat, such that:\n\\[\nx_{hab} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { C }_{ k } }  }{ N}, \\quad \\quad (Eq. 6.3)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(C_{k} = C_{c}/C_{r}\\) and \\(N\\) is the number of habitats in a region. \\(C_{c}\\) is the current condition and \\(C_{r}\\) is the reference condition specific to each \\(k\\) habitat present in the region (Table 6.2). This formulation ensures that each country is assessed only for those habitats that can exist (e.g., Canada is not assessed on the status of its nonexistent coral reefs). We generally considered the reference years to be between 1980-1995, although these varied by habitat due to data availability.\nTable 6.2. Habitat data Description of condition, extent, and trend calculations for habitat data (Note: extent is not used to calculate the habitat subgoal, but is used for the coastal protection and carbon storage goals).

Trend was rescaled to 0-1.\n\n\n\n\n\nA significant amount of pre-processing of the habitat data was needed to fill data gaps and resolve data quality issues (Section 7). Because consistent habitat monitoring data was unavailable for many countries, anomalous values can occur. This is particularly true for highly variable habitats like seagrasses or coral reefs which can have significant site-to-site and year-to-year differences in extent and condition (Bruno and Selig 2007). Biases may also have been introduced from spatial (e.g., protected or impacted sites) and temporal (e.g., directly after a disturbance event) selections in sampling. In regions where we had a limited number of surveys in a particular country, overall status can be under- or overestimated because of these fluctuations.\n\n\nTrend\nTrend in habitat data were calculated as the linear trend in extent or condition with slight variations depending on habitat type. Coral reef habitat trends were calculated on a per country basis, using all available data. For saltmarsh we apply a single global trend value to each region. For seagrasses and kelp we calculated trends on a per site basis. For mangroves we used the rate of change in areal extent over the most recent 5 years of available data. For sea ice we calculated the slope across the most recent 5 years of data, where each year of data is based on a 3-year moving averages to smooth out potential climate variation. For soft bottom habitat we simply calculated the slope of the recent change in condition over the past 5 years, i.e., the change in proportion of bottom trawl and dredge fishing per unit area of soft bottom habitat within a region.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nHabitat condition of coral (hab_coral_health): Current condition of coral habitat relative to historical condition\nHabitat condition trend

The target for the species subgoal is to have all species at a risk status of Least Concern.\n\nCurrent status\nSpecies status was calculated as the area and status-weighted average of assessed species within each region. Marine species distribution and threat category data mostly came from IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and we limited data to all species having IUCN habitat system of “marine” http://www.iucnredlist.org (IUCN 2025b, 2025a). Seabird distributions data came from Birdlife International http://datazone.birdlife.org (BirdLife International and Handbook of the Birds of the World 2025).\nWe scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be 0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions (Barnosky et al. 2011) and would constitute a catastrophic loss of biodiversity.\nThreat weights, \\(w_{i}\\), were assigned based on the IUCN threat categories status of each \\(i\\) species, following the weighting schemes developed by Butchart et al. (2007) (Table 6.3). For the purposes of this analysis, we included only data for extant species for which sufficient data were available to conduct an assessment. We did not include the Data Deficient classification as assessed species following previously published guidelines for a mid-point approach (Schipper et al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2010).\nWe first calculated each the region’s area-weighted average species risk status, \\(\\bar R_{spp}\\). For each 0.5 degree grid cell within a region, \\(c\\), the risk status, \\(w\\), for each species, \\(i\\), present is summed and multiplied by cell area \\(A_c\\), to get an area- and count-weighted species risk for each cell. This value is then divided by the sum of count-weighted area \\(A_c \\times N_c\\) across all cells within the region. The result is the area-weighted mean species risk across the entire region.\n\\[\n\\bar R_{spp} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } \\left( \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{N_c} w_i \\right) \\times A_c }\n                { \\displaystyle\\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } A_c \\times N_c },  (Eq. 6.4)\n\\] To convert \\(\\bar R_{spp}\\) into a score, we set a floor at 25% (representing a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, as noted above) and then rescaled to produce a \\(x_{spp}\\) value between zero and one.\n\\[\nx_{spp} = max \\left( \\frac { \\bar R_{SPP} - .25 }{ .75 }, 0 \\right), (Eq. 6.5)\n\\]\nTable 6.3.

    "text": "Coastal protection\nThis goal aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.). At local and regional scales data may exist on all these variables at a high enough resolution to map and calculate exactly which habitats are providing how much protection to which coastal areas. At global scales, such data do not exist and so we focused on EEZ-scale assessments, even though this scale does not allow one to account for the spatial configuration of habitats relative to coastal areas and human populations. Consequently, we assumed that all coastal areas have value (and equal value) and assessed the total area and condition of key habitats within each EEZ (without regard to their precise location relative to coastal areas). The habitats that provide protection to coastal areas for which we have global data include mangroves, coral reefs, seagrasses, kelp forests, salt marshes (Table 6.2), and coastal sea ice (shoreline pixels with &gt;15% ice cover).\n\nCurrent status\nThe status of this goal, \\(x_{cp}\\), was calculated to be a function of the relative health of the habitats, \\(k\\), within a region that provide shoreline protection, weighted by their area and protectiveness rank (Table 6.4), such that:\n\\[\nx_{cp} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { (h }_{ k } } \\times { w }_{ k }\\times { A }_{ k }) }{ \\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { (w }_{ k }\\times { A }_{ k }) }  }, (Eq. 6.6)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(w\\) is the rank weight of the habitat’s protective ability, \\(A\\) is the area within a region for each \\(k\\) habitat type, and \\(h\\) is a measure of each habitat’s condition:\n\\[\nh = \\frac { C_{ c } }{ { C }_{ r } }\n\\]\nwhere, \\(C_c\\) is current condition and \\(C_r\\) is reference condition.\nTable 6.4.

    "section": "Carbon storage",
    "text": "Carbon storage\nThe present-day pelagic ocean sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide, estimated at approximately 2000 TgC yr-1, accounts for about a quarter of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and helps mitigate a key driver of global climate change (Le Quéré et al. 2009; Sabine and Tanhua 2010). The physical-chemical mechanisms driving the ocean sink are well understood but are not directly amenable to human management. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds) have substantially larger areal carbon burial rates than terrestrial forests, and “Blue Carbon” has been suggested as an alternate, more manageable carbon sequestration approach. The rapid destruction of these coastal habitats may release large amounts of buried carbon back into the ocean-atmosphere system. Donato and colleagues (2011), for example, estimate that mangrove deforestation generates emissions of 20-120 TgC yr-1. Our focus here, therefore, is on coastal habitats because they are threatened, have large amounts of stored carbon that would rapidly be released with further habitat destruction, have the highest per-area sequestration rates of any habitat on the planet, and are amenable to management, conservation, and restoration efforts. We refer to this goal as carbon storage but intend its meaning to include sequestration.\nWe focused on four coastal habitats known to provide meaningful amounts of carbon storage (Table 6.2): mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, and tidal flats (Chen and Lee 2022). For mangroves, we used coastal mangroves that are on land or in river deltas.\n\nCurrent status\nWe measured the status of carbon storage, \\(x_{cs}\\), as a function of the carbon storing habitats’ current condition, \\(C_{c}\\), relative to their reference condition, \\(C_{r}\\). The habitat condition values were averaged, weighted by the area of each habitat, \\(A_{k}\\), and a coefficient, \\(w_k\\), to account for the relative contribution of each habitat type, \\(k\\), to total carbon storage (Laffoley and Grimsditch 2009) (Table 6.5):\n\\[\nx_{cs} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { (h }_{ k } } \\times { w }_{ k }\\times { A }_{ k }) }{ \\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { (w }_{ k }\\times { A }_{ k }) }  }, (Eq. 6.7)\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\[\nh = \\frac { C_{ c } }{ { C }_{ r } }\n\\]\nWe employed several different methods for calculating habitat condition scores depending on the habitat of interest and available data (Table 6.2).\nTable 6.5.

First, it avoids penalizing a country that naturally lacks one of the habitats (e.g., Canada is too cold to have mangroves). Second, it ensures that habitats influence the goal score proportionately to their area of extent. This rewards the protection of large extents of habitat but does not assign a higher weight to higher habitat diversity. As such, our measure underestimates the actual amount of carbon storage being done by these coastal habitats (because we cannot account for habitats we do not know exist).\nReference area for each habitat is treated as a fixed value; in cases where current area might exceed this reference value (e.g., through restoration), we cap the score at the maximum value (1.0). Although this does not give credit for restoration efforts improving things, data tend to be of poor quality making it difficult to determine true increases, and in general habitat restoration beyond reference values is extremely unlikely.\n\n\nTrend\nThe trend for this goal is calculated using different methods for each habitat due to data availability (Table 6.2).\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nHabitat extent of mangrove (hab_mangrove_extent): Area of mangrove habitat\nHabitat condition of mangrove (hab_mangrove_health): Current condition of mangrove habitat relative to historical condition\nHabitat condition trend of mangrove (hab_mangrove_trend): Estimated trend in mangrove condition\nHabitat extent of saltmarsh (hab_saltmarsh_extent): Area of saltmarsh habitat\nHabitat condition of saltmarsh (hab_saltmarsh_health): Current condition of saltmarsh habitat relative to historical condition\nHabitat condition trend of saltmarsh (hab_saltmarsh_trend): Estimated trend in saltmarsh condition\nHabitat extent of seagrass (hab_seagrass_extent): Area of seagrass habitat\nHabitat condition of seagrass (hab_seagrass_health): Current condition of seagrass habitat relative to historical condition\nHabitat condition trend of seagrass (hab_seagrass_trend): Estimated trend in seagrass condition\nHabitat extent of tidal flat (hab_tidal_flat_extent): Area of tidal flat habitat\nHabitat trend of tidal flat (hab_tidal_flat_trend): Estimated trend in tidal flat condition\nHabitat condition of tidal flat (hab_tidal_flat_health): Current condition of tidal flat habitat relative to historical condition\nPressure\nOcean acidification (cc_acid): Pressure due to increasing ocean acidification, scaled using biological thresholds\nSea level rise (cc_slr): Pressure due to rising mean sea level\nSea surface temperature (cc_sst): Presure due to increasing extreme sea surface temperature events\nIntertidal habitat destruction (hd_intertidal): Coastal population density (25 mi from shore) as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction\nCoastal chemical pollution (po_chemicals_3nm): Modeled chemical pollution within 3nm of coastline from commercial shipping traffic, ports and harbors, land-based pesticide use (organic pollution), and urban runoff (inorganic pollution)\nCoastal nutrient pollution (po_nutrients_3nm): Modeled nutrient pollution within 3nm based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nNonindigenous species (sp_alien): Measure of harmful invasive species\nWeakness of social progress (ss_spi): Inverse of Social Progress Index scores\nWeakness of governance (ss_wgi): Inverse of World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\nResilience\nManagement of habitat to protect habitat biodiversity (hd_habitat): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: habitat related questions\nCoastal protected marine areas (habitat preservation) (hd_mpa_coast): Protected marine areas within 3nm of coastline (lasting special places goal status score)\nManagement of waters to preserve biodiversity (po_water): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: clean water management related questions\nSocial Progress Index (res_spi): Social Progress Index scores\nStrength of governance (wgi_all): World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores",

    "section": "Clean waters",
    "text": "Clean waters\nPeople value marine waters that are free of pollution and debris for aesthetic and health reasons. Contamination of waters comes from oil spills, chemicals, eutrophication, algal blooms, disease pathogens (e.g., fecal coliform, viruses, and parasites from sewage outflow), floating trash, and mass kills of organisms due to pollution. People are sensitive to these phenomena occurring in areas they access for recreation or other purposes as well as for simply knowing that clean waters exist. This goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero.\nWe include four measures of pollution in the clean waters goal: eutrophication (nutrients), chemicals, pathogens and marine debris. This decision was meant to represent a comprehensive list of the contamination categories that are commonly considered in assessments of coastal clean waters (Borja et al. 2008) and for which we could obtain datasets (Table 6.6). The status of these components is the inverse of their intensity (i.e., high input results in low status score).\nTable 6.6.

(2022) and Tuholske et al. (2021). The modeled proxy approach does not allow the distinction between toxic and non-toxic bloom events that can arise from excess nutrient input (often both referred to in the literature as harmful algal blooms, or HABs) or at what nutrient concentration an ecosystem is pushed into a HAB condition (i.e., the threshold value). Local studies may be able to obtain information on such non-linear responses and include it as part of this status measure.\nFor the chemical pollution component (Halpern et al. 2008), we used a combination of modeled input of fertilizer input as a proxy for land-based organic pollution, and impermeable surfaces as a proxy for land-based organic pollution, and shipping and port traffic for ocean based pollution. We were not able to assess specific toxic chemicals at the global scale; however regional case studies often will have data available for the quantities and toxicity of a range of chemicals put into watersheds and coastal waters. We also did not have global data for oil spills and so could not include oil pollution, but in future assessments where such data exist it would be included in chemical pollution as well.\nHuman-derived pathogens are found in coastal waters primarily from sewage discharge or direct human defecation. Since we did not have access to a global database of in situ measurements of pathogen levels, we used a proxy measure for the status of pathogen pollution, namely the number of people in coastal areas without access to improved sanitation facilities (WHO-UNICEF 2024). The underlying assumption is that locations with a low number of people with access to improved facilities will likely have higher levels of coastal water contamination from human pathogens. To estimate this pathogen intensity, we multiplied the human population within 25 miles of the coast by the percentage of population without access to improved sanitation. This allows countries with low coastal population densities and low access to improved sanitation to score better than high population countries with better access if the absolute number of people without access is lower in the small country.\nThe status of trash pollution was estimated using globally-available plastic pollution data (Eriksen et al. 2014).\n\nCurrent status\nThe status of this goal, \\(x_{cw}\\), was calculated as the geometric mean of the four components, such that:\n\\[\nx_{cw} = \\sqrt [ 4 ]{ a\\ast u\\ast l\\ast d },  (Eq. 6.8)\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) = 1 - the number of people without access to sanitation, rescaled to the global maximum; \\(u\\) = 1 – (nutrient input), rescaled at the raster level by the 99th quantile value; \\(l\\) = 1 – (chemical input), rescaled at the raster level by the 99.99th quantile value; and \\(d\\) = 1 – (marine debris), rescaled at the raster level by the 99.99th quantile value.\nWe used a geometric mean, as is commonly done for water quality indices (Liou, Lo, and Wang 2004), because a very bad score for any one subcomponent would pollute the waters sufficiently to make people feel the waters were ‘too dirty’ to enjoy for recreational or aesthetic purposes (e.g., a large oil spill trumps any other measure of pollution). However, in cases where a subcomponent was zero, we added a value of 0.01 (on a scale of 0 to 1) to prevent the overall score from going to zero. Given that there is uncertainty around our pollution estimates, a zero score resulting from one subcomponent seemed too extreme.\nAlthough clean waters are relevant and important anywhere in the ocean, coastal waters drive this goal both because the problems of pollution are concentrated there and because people predominantly access and care about clean waters in coastal areas. The nearshore area is what people can see and where beach-going, shoreline fishing, and other activities occur. Furthermore, the data for high seas areas is limited and there is little meaningful regulation or governance over the input of pollution into these areas. We therefore calculate this goal only for the first 3 nm of ocean for each country’s EEZ. We chose 3 nm for several reasons, but found the status results to be relatively insensitive to different distances.\nA number of potential components of clean water were not included due to lack of global datasets, including toxic algal blooms, oil spills, turbidity (sediment input), and floating trash.

    "text": "Food Provision\nOne of the most fundamental services the ocean provides people is the provision of seafood. From meeting the basic nutritional needs of over half of the world’s population to being sold in high-end sushi restaurants, seafood is an important benefit of healthy oceans. This goal measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested within an EEZ or region through any means for use primarily in human consumption and thus includes wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale and recreational fisheries. Importantly, seafood harvest using unsustainable fishing practices or catch levels is penalized as the goal aims to maximize the amount of sustainably produced seafood from wild or cultured stocks. Because we do not track where the fish go after being caught or produced, this goal does not aim to measure food security for the population of a given country, but instead measures the food provided from its waters.\nThe status of the food provision goal is calculated as the mean of the fisheries and mariculture subgoals, weighted by their relative contribution in tonnes to food production for each region.\n\nFisheries (subgoal of food provision)\nThis model aims to assess the amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested with penalties assigned for over-harvesting. As such, one must establish a reference point at which harvest is both maximal and sustainable. We assess food provision from wild caught fisheries by estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (\\(B/B_{MSY}\\)) for each stock. When available, we obtained \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database (Ricard et al. 2012; RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database 2025), which contains stock assessment information for a portion of global fish stocks. When RAM data were not available, we used data-limited approaches that have been developed to estimate \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values using globally available catch data (C. Costello et al. 2012; Martell and Froese 2013; Thorson et al. 2013; Rosenberg et al. 2014; Christopher Costello et al. 2016). To calculate the status for each region and year, \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values were converted to a stock status score between 0-1 that penalizes over-harvesting. To obtain the overall status for each region, the stock status scores for all the stocks within a region were averaged using a geometric mean weighted by the average catch (tonnes) of each stock using Sea Around Us catch data (D. Pauly, Zeller, and Palomareas 2020).\nFigure 6.1: Overview of fisheries status calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent status\nSpatial allocation of catch to regions\nThe data we use to calculate \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) and the weights used in the geometric mean are from Sea Around Us (2020) global marine fisheries catch data (D. Pauly, Zeller, and Palomareas 2020). Sea Around Us (2020) uses a spatial allocation method to distribute FAO catch data (reported at the country scale) to a global grid of one half-degree cell resolution based on the spatial distribution of fished taxa from FishBase (R. Froese and Pauly 2022) and SeaLifeBase (Palomares and Pauly 2022).\nWe use the Sea Around Us (2020) catch data in two ways. To get the data needed to weight the stock status scores, we download the total catch for each taxa within each region’s EEZ to get the total catch in tonnes for each year. To get the data needed to calculate \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values, we download the total catch for each taxa within each major fishing region (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department 2015) for each year. We have traditionally included all fisheries catch in the Fisheries subgoal. However, a substantial portion of the catch is not used for human consumption, but rather for fish oil and fish meal used primarily for animal feed. Currently, it is estimated about 10% of forage fish enter the human diet directly (Froehlich 2018). To account for this, we excluded the proportion of catch that produce fish oil and fish meal for animal feed from the total catch.\nTo combine the \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values from the RAM database with the Sea Around Us (2020) global fish catch data, we used the spatial boundaries that Christopher Free created for the RAM stocks up to 2017 and assigned FAO and OHI regions to each stock (Free 2017). Newly added stocks to the RAM database had some spatially explicit information, but were mostly manually assigned regions based on best available information on stock distribution.\nEstimating \\(B/B_{MSY}\\)\nWhen we were unable to obtain \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values from the RAM database for a stock, we calculated them using a data-poor, or catch only model, developed by Martell & Froese (2013), and hereafter referred to as the “catch-MSY” method. The latter was chosen, among other data-limited methods because it was as good, or better, at predicting RAM \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values than other methods based on our initial testing. We compared \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) scores from three catch models (catch-MSY, SSCOM, and COMSIR) as well as a variety of ensemble methods (Anderson et al. 2017). The catch_MSY model performed as well or better than the other models at predicting RAM \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values. Furthermore, this method performed well (although not as well as the Random Forest ensemble approach, based on a rank correlation analysis) in analyses using simulated stocks with a broad range of life history traits and different known sources of uncertainty (Anderson et al. 2017).\nWe defined a stock as species occurring within a major fishing area, and consequently, we ran the catch-MSY model using yearly catch data aggregated to FAO region from 1950 to the most current year. We chose this definition because many fish populations straddle the boundaries of EEZs. Any aggregation method will be biased in some way, but populations with the largest catches are most often straddling stocks, so a bias in assessments due to erroneous aggregation of catch could occur more often with cosmopolitan species that include small, sedentary (i.e., patchily distributed) populations that are less likely to play a dominant role in a country’s fisheries. The catch-MSY model was applied only to stocks identified to the species level.\nThe catch-MSY method is based on the same assumptions used in many stock assessment models (Schaefer 1954), namely that the change in a population’s biomass depends on its biomass in the previous year and two population-specific parameters: the carrying capacity (\\({K}\\)) and rate of population increase (\\({r}\\)). The method estimates the status of a given population using landings time-series as proxies for biomass removals from the population, and using empirically derived relationships of relative peak to current catch values to estimate depletion at the end of the time series (Martell and Froese 2013). Then, a sampling procedure is used to estimate the distribution of values of \\({r}\\) and \\({K}\\) that are compatible with the estimated current depletion levels, and are constrained within the range that maintains viable population abundance and at the same time does not exceed the population’s carrying capacity. In the original formulation of Martell & Froese (2013) the geometric mean \\({r}\\) and \\({K}\\) were used to derive an estimate of MSY. Rosenberg et al. (2014) modified this method by producing a biomass time series for each of the viable \\({r-K}\\) pairs using the surplus production model. The arithmetic mean biomass time series was selected and the current year stock abundance (\\({B}\\)) relative to the abundance that achieves \\({MSY}\\) (\\(B_{MSY}\\)) produced a measure, \\(B/B_{MSY}\\).\nA potential issue of the catch-MSY method (when using the default “constrained” prior) is that declining catch is assumed to indicate declining population biomass (resulting in lower \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values) rather than reduced effort or improved management. When declining catch is known to be due to reduced effort and/or improved management this results in artificially low \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values; however, the catch-MSY model can be modified by using a “uniform” prior distribution for the final biomass. However, this adjustment should be considered carefully because the model will assume that all stocks with declining catch are rebuilding (resulting in higher \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values), which is unrealistic. Previously, for the 2015 assessment, we attempted to use the constrained vs. uniform prior for each stock based on the catch weighted fishery management scores of the regions catching the stock. However, recent analyses suggest this method did not improve the ability of the catch-MSY derived \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values to predict RAM values, suggesting we were adding additional complication that did not improve our model. Consequently, all analyses are done using the “constrained” prior.\nWeights for stock status scores\nTo get the data needed to weight the stock status scores, we sum the total catch for each taxa within each region’s EEZ to get the total catch in tonnes for each year. We then average each taxa’s catch within each region across all years from 1980 to the most current year’s data. Consequently, for a taxa within a region, the average catch value is the same across all years (only the \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) value will vary across years.). This provides an estimate of the mean potential contribution of each species to total food provision, independent of yearly stochastic fluctuations of the population and possible recent declines.\nGoal model calculations\nThe status of wild caught fisheries, \\(x_{fis}\\), for each reporting region in each year was calculated as the geometric mean of the stock status scores, \\(SS\\) (derived from \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) score for each stock, described below) and weighted by the stock’s relative contribution to overall catch, \\(C\\), such that:\n\\[\nx_{fis} = \\prod _{ i=1 }^{ n }{ { SS }_{ i }^{ (\\frac { { C }_{ i } }{ \\sum { { C }_{ i } }  } ) } },  (Eq. 6.9)\n\\]\nwhere \\({i}\\) is an individual taxon and \\(n\\) is the total number of taxa in the reported catch for each region throughout the time-series, and \\({C}\\) is the average catch, since the first non null record, for each taxon within each region.\nWe used a geometric weighted mean to account for the portfolio effect of exploiting a diverse suite of resources, such that small stocks that are doing poorly will have a stronger influence on the overall score than they would using an arithmetic weighted mean, even though their \\({C}\\) contributes relatively little to the overall tonnage of harvested seafood within a given region. The behavior of the geometric mean is such that improving a well-performing stock is not rewarded as much as improving one that is doing poorly. We believe this behavior is desirable because the recovery of stocks in poor condition requires more effort and can have more important effects on the system than making a species that is already abundant even more abundant. In this way, the score is not solely driven by absolute tonnes of fish produced and accounts for preserving the health of a diversity of species.\n\\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values were used to derive stock status scores, \\({SS}\\), such that the best score is achieved for stocks at \\(B/B_{MSY} = 1\\%\\), with a 5% error buffer, and it decreases as the distance of \\(B\\) from \\(B_{MSY}\\) increases, due to over-exploitation (Figure 6.2). For each species reported, within each major fishing area, the stock status score was calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere, for \\(B/B_{MSY} &lt; 1\\) (with a 5% buffer), status declines with direct proportionality to the decline of \\(\\beta\\) with respect to \\(B_{MSY}\\), while for \\(B/B_{MSY} &gt; 1\\), status is given a perfect score. Thus, consistent with previous work (Halpern et al. 2012), countries are rewarded for having wild stocks at the biomass that can sustainably deliver the maximum sustainable yield, -5% to allow for measurement error, and are penalized for over-harvesting.\nFor the 2021 assessment, we decided to exclude all underharvest penalties because by applying an underharvest penalty, we ended up unduly penalizing regions that have high proportions of underharvested stocks, which may be intentional in many cases. This suggests that an improvement to our fisheries approach by including a more just underharvest penalty could be needed.\nFigure 6.2: Conversion of \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) to stock status, \\(SS\\) score.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe needed to gapfill missing status, \\(SS\\), scores for a large proportion of the catch. Gapfilling was necessary because we could only estimate \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values for taxa identified to the species level. Furthermore, we were unable to estimate \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values for some species due to too few years of catch data. Missing status scores were gapfilled using the mean status scores of the stocks sharing a region and year, the mean value was then adjusted using a taxonomic reporting penalty (Table 6.7). For catch not reported to the species level, a penalty was applied for increasingly coarser taxonomic reporting, as this is considered a sign of minimal monitoring and management. We based the penalty on the ISSCAAP convention for taxon codes (http://www.fao.org/fishery/collection/asfis/en), which defines 6 levels of taxonomic aggregation, from 6 (species) to 1 (order or higher). When \\({g}&lt;6\\), a penalized gapfilled value for status was estimated for the taxa in each region:\nTable 6.7: Penalty applied to gapfilled stock status scores The penalty is multiplied by the gapfilled stock status score to obtain the final stock status score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nISSCAAP taxon code\nDescription\nPenalty (gapfilled score multiplied by value)\n\n\n\n\n1\ne.g., Marine fishes not identified, Miscellaneous marine molluscs\n0.1\n\n\n2\nClass, Subclass, Subphylum (e.g., Cephalopoda, Holocephali, Crustacea)\n0.25\n\n\n3\nOrder (e.g., Chimaeriformes, Octopoda)\n0.5\n\n\n4\nFamily (e.g., Lamnidae, Squillidae)\n0.8\n\n\n5\nGenus (e.g., Strongylocentrotus, Scyllarides)\n0.9\n\n\n6\nSpecies\n1 (no penalty)\n\n\n\nModel limitations\nThis model is based on single-species assessments of stock status and thus cannot predict the effect of multi-species interactions. This model adopts \\(B=B_{MSY}\\) as a single-species reference point, which by various assessment frameworks is considered very conservative (e.g., Rainer Froese et al. (2011)), and the fact that the single-species values are aggregated using a geometric mean ensures that some multi-species effects may influence the scores. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the emerging effects of fishing various species at their reference levels would be desirable and will hopefully be possible in the future.\nDespite the fact that invertebrates represent a large proportion of global caught biomass, and represent the dominant stocks in many regions, stock assessment approaches for these taxa are poorly developed. The catch-MSY approach was applied to invertebrates even though the model developers only tested it on fish (Martell and Froese 2013). Part of the challenge in broadly testing this approach on organisms other than fish is the lack of a large enough collection of invertebrate assessments to use for validation testing.\nThis approach captures whether stocks have been historically well managed, but it is worth noting that it does not directly measure current food production.\n\n\nTrend\nTrend was calculated as described in section 5.3.1.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nB/Bmsy estimates (fis_b_bmsy): The ratio of fish population abundance compared to the abundance required to deliver maximum sustainable yield (RAM and catch-MSY data)\nFishery catch data (fis_meancatch): Mean commercial catch for each OHI region (averaged across years)\nPressure\nHigh bycatch due to artisanal fishing (fp_art_hb): Pressure due to artisanal high bycatch fishing identified by discard tonnes and standardized by NPP\nLow bycatch due to artisanal fishing (fp_art_lb): Pressure due to artisanal low bycatch fishing identified by reported and IUU tonnes and standardized by NPP\nHigh bycatch due to commercial fishing (fp_com_hb): Pressure due to industrial high bycatch fishing identified by discard tonnes and standardized by NPP\nLow bycatch due to commercial fishing (fp_com_lb): Pressure due to industrial low bycatch fishing identified by reported and IUU tonnes and standardized by NPP\nIntertidal habitat destruction (hd_intertidal): Coastal population density (25 mi from shore) as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction\nSubtidal hardbottom habitat destruction (hd_subtidal_hb): Presence of blast fishing as an estimate of subtidal hard bottom habitat destruction\nSubtidal soft bottom habitat destruction (hd_subtidal_sb): Pressure on soft-bottom habitats due to demersal destructive commercial fishing practices (e.g., trawling)\nChemical pollution (po_chemicals): Modeled chemical pollution within EEZ from commercial shipping traffic, ports and harbors, land-based pesticide use (organic pollution), and urban runoff (inorganic pollution)\nNutrient pollution (po_nutrients): Modeled nutrient pollution within EEZ based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nNonindigenous species (sp_alien): Measure of harmful invasive species\nGenetic escapes (sp_genetic): Introduced mariculture species (Mariculture Sustainability Index) as a proxy for genetic escapes\nWeakness of social progress (ss_spi): Inverse of Social Progress Index scores\nWeakness of governance (ss_wgi): Inverse of World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\nResilience\nManagement of habitat to protect fisheries biodiversity (fp_habitat): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: habitat related questions\nMinderoo Global Fishing Index (fp_fish_management): Country scale fisheries governance capacity based on policy and objectives, management capacity, information availability and monitoring, level and control of access to fisheries resources, compliance management system, and stakeholder engagement and participation\nArtisanal fisheries management effectiveness (fp_artisanal): Quality of management of small-scale fishing for artisanal and recreational purposes\nEEZ protected marine areas (fishing preservation) (fp_mpa_eez): Protected marine areas within EEZ (lasting special places calculation applied to the entire EEZ)\nManagement of habitat to protect habitat biodiversity (hd_habitat): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: habitat related questions\nEEZ protected marine areas (habitat preservation) (hd_mpa_eez): Protected marine areas within EEZ (lasting special places calculation applied to the entire EEZ)\nSocial Progress Index (res_spi): Social Progress Index scores\nMeasure of ecological integrity (species_diversity_eez): Marine species condition (species subgoal status score) as a proxy for ecological integrity\nStrength of governance (wgi_all): World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\n\n\n\nMariculture (subgoal of food provision)\nThe mariculture subgoal attempts to measure each region’s food production from mariculture relative to its capacity (United Nations 2025) and sustainability (Monterey Bay Aquarium 2025). A basic problem facing previous assessments of mariculture was the lack of an ecologically- and socially-based reference point for the potential yield of every suitable mariculture species for every type of geographic habitat and location. Determining such reference points for every country at the global scale is difficult, not only because of key missing data and information, but also because species, genotypes and habitats suitable for production in any given location are likely to change from year to year. However, recent research (Gentry et al. 2019) estimated the global biological potential for marine aquaculture at a high resolution spatial scale, addressing one of these key gaps: ecological reference points. To account for the social and economic realities and constraints to these ecological potentials, we constrained the per-country potential to 1% of this tonnage estimate and used these country values as reference points. Furthermore, the paper does not exclude high biodiversity or environmentally sensitive areas, meaning 100% of potential aquaculture tonnage estimate is a large overestimation of what is actually possible. Additionally, we include a sustainability score for each species in each region which is based on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch aquaculture recommendations (Monterey Bay Aquarium 2025).\n\nCurrent status\nThe status of the mariculture subgoal, \\(x_{mar}\\), was defined as production of strictly marine taxa from FAO categories for both marine and brackish waters, excluding species that were not used as a source of food for human consumption. In particular this was only an issue for seaweeds, as many seaweed species are not used for human consumption (or only partially used for human consumption). Table 6.8 shows the proportions, with a justification column, explaining the proportions of each seaweed species used for human consumption.\nTable 6.8 Mariculture seaweed exclusion.

Mariculture status, \\(x_{mar}\\), was therefore assessed as the current re-scaled met potential of harvested yield, \\(Y_{c}\\), within each country, multiplied by the production weighted average of sustainability of mariculture within each county, \\(S_{c}\\), such that:\n\\[\nx_{mar} = Y_{c} \\ \\times \\ S_{c},  \\   (Eq. 6.10)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(Y_{c}\\), is the current re-scaled met potential of harvested yield within each country, c, such that:\n\\[\nY_{c}= \\frac {\\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { Y }_{ k } }}{Y_{r, ref}}, \\  (Eq. 6.11)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(Y_{r,ref}\\) is the value that corresponds to 1% of the potential aquaculture harvest in each region, and \\(Y_{k}\\) is the 4-year moving window average of tonnes of production (United Nations 2025) for each \\({k}\\) mariculture species that is currently or at one time cultured within a country. \\(Y_{c}\\) is then capped at 1, so that no country can receive a better-than-perfect score. \\(S_{c}\\) is the production weighted average of sustainability of mariculture in each country, such that:\n\\[\nS_{c}  =  \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { Y }_{ k }{ S }_{ k,r } }  } {{\\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { Y }_{ k } }}}, (Eq. 6.12)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(Y_{k}\\) is the 4-year moving window average of tonnes of production (United Nations 2025) for each \\({k}\\) mariculture species that is currently or at one time cultured within a country, and \\(S_{k,r}\\) is the sustainability score for each \\(k\\) mariculture species and region.\nAll regions scoring above 1.0 are given a score of 1.0. A score of one could occur when the current aquaculture harvest is greater than 1% of the biological production potential (taken from (Gentry et al. 2019)) and mariculture harvest is perfectly sustainable within a region. However, when a region has a current harvested yield that is less than 100 tonnes, and when 1% of potential mariculture harfvest is less than 100 tonnes, a score of NA is assigned. This assumption is made to avoid giving a perfect score to regions that have essentially zero harvested yield, and essentially zero biological production potential.\nThe sustainability score, \\(S_{k,r}\\), for each species in each region is based on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch aquaculture recommendations (Monterey Bay Aquarium 2025). Ten mariculture practice criteria from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (data quality, effluent, habitat risk, chemical use, feed, escapes, disease, source of stock, predator and wildlife mortalities, and escape of secondary species). These criteria represent the internal mariculture practices with the potential to affect the long term sustainability of the mariculture system. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw SFW score of 10 and minimum of 1. These scores are country and species-specific, however, many country/species combinations are not assessed by Seafood Watch. Given that each mariculture record must have a corresponding sustainability score, we used a series of steps to estimate sustainability scores for every country and species. If a country/species match was available we used that, otherwise, we gapfilled using the following sequence:\n\nUsed the global species value provided by Seafood Watch.\nWithin a country, used the average of species within the same family.\nWithin a UN geo-political region, used the average of species within the same family.\nGlobal, used average of species within the same family.\nGlobal, used average of species within a broad taxonomic grouping (e.g., crustaceans, algae, bivalves, etc.).\nFinally, if these scores were not available for the categories above, we used the global average of all species.\n\nSeaweed or algae species were given the global seaweed sustainability score provided by the Seafood Watch recommendations. We are aware that there is some bias associated with using scores derived as averages across countries because they were originally assigned to specific species-country pairs, nevertheless this is preferable to applying a sustainability score solely based on a subset of the species harvested.\n\n\nTrend\nTrend was calculated as described in section 5.3.1.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nMariculture harvest (mar_harvest_tonnes): Tonnes of mariculture harvest\nMariculture sustainability score (mar_sustainability_score): Mariculture sustainability based on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations.\nPotential tonnes of mariculture harvest (mar_capacity): Tonnes of mariculture harvest potential for each region based on biological variables and growth performance indices.

    "text": "Livelihoods and economies\nDue to discontinued and non-updated source datasets, we have not updated the status of this goal since 2013 (changes across scenario years after 2013 are due to changes in pressures/resilience).\nThe jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even those who do not directly participate in the industries but value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy.\nThis goal is composed of two equally important sub-goals, livelihoods and economies, which are assessed across as many marine-related sectors as possible (Table 6.8). Livelihoods includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs, which is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages, which is a proxy for job quality. Economies is composed of a single component, revenue. We track the two halves of this goal separately because the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced are both of considerable interest to stakeholders and governments, and could show very different patterns in some cases (e.g., high revenue sectors do not necessarily provide large employment opportunities). The status of the livelihoods and economies goal is the average of the livelihoods and economies subgoals.\nThe total value of economic industries cannot be captured fully by measuring only the jobs and revenue generated directly by those industries, since activity in the direct industry stimulates additional jobs and revenue in related industries. For example, the fishing industry provides direct jobs to fishers, indirect jobs to fishing gear manufacturing companies, and induced jobs to the restaurants and movie theaters where those manufacturing employees spend their income. In the case of tourism, data describing total jobs and revenue (direct plus indirect and induced) were available from the primary data source, and so we used that information as the best estimate of total employment and total revenue for that sector. For all other sectors we used sector- and development status-specific multipliers derived from the literature to estimate total job or revenue impacts. We did not apply multiplier values to wages since the cascading effects of earned income are more contentious. We assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers are static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing countries (when such information was available), because we do not have data to resolve temporal or regional differences (Table 6.9). Countries were classified as developed or developing using the Human Development Index (HDI, UNDP (2010)), with all countries identified as “very high human development” classified as developed and all others as developing. We classified regions not assessed by the HDI by compiling information used to calculate the HDI score (schooling, life expectancy and per capita Gross National Income statistics).\nFor a job or wage sector to be included in our assessment it needed to report at least two time points and have data for all or most coastal regions (reported separately, not as a single global number). However, a sector did not need to have data for all three measures – jobs, wages, and revenue – as this would have eliminated almost every sector. Consequently, the sectors that comprise each of the three measures differ (Table 6.8) and there is variation across regions in which sectors and measures comprise the status score (because of gaps in datasets and the fact that not all sectors exist in all countries). If a region only had one data layer (a single sector for only one measure), a status score was not calculated for that region and instead, a regional average was applied. We used a weighted average of the region’s UN geopolitical region; revenue values were weighted by each region’s GDP, jobs were weighted by each region’s workforce size, and wages were unweighted.\nA number of sectors were not included primarily because sufficient data do not exist. In the future, particularly in finer scale applications, it would be desirable to include these sectors, including (but not limited to) ecotourism (beyond just cetacean watching), sailing/kayaking/boating, surfing/kiteboarding, etc., offshore wind and wave energy, navigation assistance, safety and security, coastal development, scientific research, and restoration and conservation.\nTable 6.9.

It does not attempt to capture any aspects of job identity (i.e., the reputation, desirability or other social or cultural perspectives associated with different jobs), although one can examine the component parts that make up this goal to evaluate individual sectors and infer implications for job identity. We make the assumption that all marine-related jobs are equivalent, such that, for example, a fisherman could transition to a job in mariculture or ship-building without affecting the score of this goal. While job identity has social and cultural value, there are not adequate data to track individual workers and assess their job satisfaction on a global scale. We also do not include any measure of petroleum extraction, as we do not consider these practices to be related to the biophysical state of the system and, because they rely on a non-renewable resource, they are inherently unsustainable. Furthermore, because of data constraints, this goal does not provide more credit for sectors or economic activities that are more ecologically sustainable. Future, finer scale applications of the Index may incorporate these key considerations.\nGaps were filled in the adjustment datasets (national GDP and national employment) by first determining the average metric value (e.g., average employment rate) in UN geopolitical regions (Nations (2013b)) for each year based on all countries in that region for which there were data. Using these regional average time series, we fit nonlinear models to the adjustment data. Using the model fit, we determined the slope between each year. To fill in missing data points in country time series, we applied the slope (percent change in the metric) between the missing year and the following year (or previous year, if necessary). We prioritized filling in backwards (e.g., if a country has data from 2006 and 2008, to fill in 2007, one would use the regional delta between 2008 and 2007), but filled forwards when there were no data for a subsequent year.\n\nEconomies (subgoal of livelihoods and economies)\nAfter remaining static since 2013 (changes across scenario years after 2013 are due to changes in pressures/resilience) (Nations 2013a), the economies subgoal was initially overhauled in 2025, with room for improvement during subsequent assessments.\nThis subgoal measures the revenue produced from marine-related industries.\n\nCurrent status\nThe model to estimate the status of the economies sub-goal, \\(x_{eco}\\), is:\n\\[\nx_{eco} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { e }_{ c,k } }  }{ \\displaystyle\\sum _{ k=1 }^{ N }{ { e }_{ r,k } }  }, (Eq. 6.13)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(e\\) is the total adjusted revenue generated directly and indirectly from sector \\(k\\), at current \\(c\\), and reference \\(r\\), time points.\nBecause there is no absolute global reference point for revenue (i.e., a target number would be completely arbitrary), the economies subgoal uses a moving baseline as the reference point. Reference revenue is calculated as the value in the current year (or most recent year), relative to the value in a recent moving reference period, defined as 5 years prior to the current year. This reflects an implicit goal of maintaining coastal revenue on short time scales, allowing for decadal or generational shifts in what people want and expect. We allowed for a longer or shorter gap between the current and recent years if a 5 year span was not available from the data, but the gap could not be greater than 10 years. Our preferred gap between years was as follows (in order of preference): 5, 6, 4, 7, 3, 8, 2, 9, 1, and 10 years.\nAbsolute values for \\(e\\) in the current and reference periods were lumped across all sectors before calculating reference values (even though the current and reference years will not be exactly the same for all sectors), allowing a decrease in one sector to be balanced by an increase in another sector. As such, we do not track the status of individual sectors and instead always focus on the status of all sectors together.\nTo control for inflation/deflation, we used a standard dollar year. To account for broader economic forces that may affect revenue independent of changes in ocean health (e.g., a global recession), we adjusted revenue based on a country’s GDP (i.e., must keep pace with growth in GDP). The current and reference years used for GDP data were based on the average current year and average reference year across the sector data sources used for revenue.\n\n\nTrend\nTrend was calculated as the slope in the individual sector values (not summed sectors) for revenue over the most recent five years (as opposed to the status, which examines changes between two points in time, current versus five years prior to current), corrected by GDP. We calculated the average for revenue by averaging slopes across sectors weighted by the revenue in each sector.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nEconomic status scores (eco_status): Calculated using corrected revenue data for several marine sectors (data not updated since 2013)\nEconomic trend scores (eco_trend): Calculated using change in revenue for several marine sectors (data not updated since 2013)\nSectors in each region (le_sector_weight): Proportion of jobs within each marine sector\nPressure\nOcean acidification (cc_acid): Pressure due to increasing ocean acidification, scaled using biological thresholds\nSea level rise (cc_slr): Pressure due to rising mean sea level\nSea surface temperature (cc_sst): Presure due to increasing extreme sea surface temperature events\nHigh bycatch due to artisanal fishing (fp_art_hb): Pressure due to artisanal high bycatch fishing identified by discard tonnes and standardized by NPP\nLow bycatch due to artisanal fishing (fp_art_lb): Pressure due to artisanal low bycatch fishing identified by reported and IUU tonnes and standardized by NPP\nHigh bycatch due to commercial fishing (fp_com_hb): Pressure due to industrial high bycatch fishing identified by discard tonnes and standardized by NPP\nLow bycatch due to commercial fishing (fp_com_lb): Pressure due to industrial low bycatch fishing identified by reported and IUU tonnes and standardized by NPP\nIntertidal habitat destruction (hd_intertidal): Coastal population density (25 mi from shore) as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction\nSubtidal hardbottom habitat destruction (hd_subtidal_hb): Presence of blast fishing as an estimate of subtidal hard bottom habitat destruction\nSubtidal soft bottom habitat destruction (hd_subtidal_sb): Pressure on soft-bottom habitats due to demersal destructive commercial fishing practices (e.g., trawling)\nChemical pollution (po_chemicals): Modeled chemical pollution within EEZ from commercial shipping traffic, ports and harbors, land-based pesticide use (organic pollution), and urban runoff (inorganic pollution)\nNutrient pollution (po_nutrients): Modeled nutrient pollution within EEZ based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nCoastal nutrient pollution (po_nutrients_3nm): Modeled nutrient pollution within 3nm based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nPathogen pollution (po_pathogens): Percent of population without access to improved sanitation facilities as a proxy for pathogen pollution\nMarine plastics (po_trash): Global marine plastic pollution\nNonindigenous species (sp_alien): Measure of harmful invasive species\nGenetic escapes (sp_genetic): Introduced mariculture species (Mariculture Sustainability Index) as a proxy for genetic escapes\nWeakness of social progress (ss_spi): Inverse of Social Progress Index scores\nWeakness of governance (ss_wgi): Inverse of World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\nResilience\nGlobal Competitiveness Index (GCI) (li_gci): Competitiveness in achieving sustained economic prosperity\nSocial Progress Index (res_spi): Social Progress Index scores\nStrength of governance (wgi_all): World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\n\n\n\nLivelihoods (subgoal of livelihoods and economies)\nThe livelihoods subgoal was also static since 2013, but initially overahuled in 2025. As with the economies subgoal, there is room for improvement in future assessments.\nThis subgoal measures the jobs produced from marine-related industries. Livelihoods includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs, which is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages, which is a proxy for job quality.\nTourism quantity and revenue data come from the World Travel and Tourism Center (World Travel and Tourism Council 2024). Tourism quality data comes from the International Labor Organization (International Labour Organization 2025) Average monthly earnings of employees by sex and economic activity looking at the categories of accommodation and food service activities and arts, entertainment and recreation.\n\nCurrent status\nThe status of the livelihoods sub-goal, \\(x_{liv}\\), is calculated as:\n\\[\nx_{liv} = \\frac { \\frac { \\sum _{ 1 }^{ k }{ { j }_{ c,k } }  }{ \\sum _{ 1 }^{ k }{ { j }_{ r,k } }  } \\quad +\\quad \\frac { \\sum _{ 1 }^{ k }{ { w }_{ m,k } }  }{ \\sum _{ 1 }^{ k }{ { w }_{ r,k } }  }  }{ 2 }, (Eq. 6.14)\n\\]\nwhere \\(j\\) is the adjusted number of direct and indirect jobs within sector \\(k\\) within a region and \\(w\\) is the average PPP-adjusted wages per job within the sector. Jobs are summed across sectors and measured at current, \\(c\\), and reference, \\(r\\), time points. Adjusted wage data are averaged across sectors within each region, \\(m\\), and the reference country, \\(r\\), with the highest average wages across all sectors.\nBecause there is no absolute global reference point for jobs (i.e., a target number would be completely arbitrary), this component of the livelihoods subgoal uses a moving baseline as the reference point. Jobs, \\(j\\), are calculated as a relative value: the value in the current year (or most recent year), \\(c\\), relative to the value in a recent moving reference period, \\(r\\), defined as 5 years prior to \\(c\\). This reflects an implicit goal of maintaining coastal jobs on short time scales, allowing for decadal or generational shifts in what people want and expect. We allowed for a longer or shorter gap between the current and recent years if a 5 year span was not available from the data, but the gap could not be greater than 10 years. Our preferred gap between years was as follows (in order of preference): 5, 6, 4, 7, 3, 8, 2, 9, 1, and 10 years. For wages, \\(w\\), we assumed the reference value was the highest value observed across all regions.\nAbsolute values for \\(j\\) and \\(w\\) in the current and reference period (jobs) or region (wages) were lumped across all sectors before calculating relative values (even though the current and reference years will not be exactly the same for all sectors), allowing a decrease in one sector to be balanced by an increase in another sector. As such, we do not track the status of individual sectors and instead always focus on the status of all sectors together. For wages, we use the most current data available for each country and each sector, but only use data from 1990 on, assuming that wages are relatively slow to change over time (apart from inflation adjustments, which we control for by using real dollars) and thus can be compared across sectors and countries without controlling for year.\nWages data were divided by the inflation conversion factor so that wage data across years would be comparable in 2010 US dollars (inflation conversion factors were downloaded from http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr). These data were also multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita GDP from the World Bank. To account for broader economic forces that may affect jobs independent of changes in ocean health (e.g., a global recession), we adjusted jobs data by dividing by percent employment for the corresponding year: (1 – percent unemployment) * total labor force (World Bank 2014a, 2014b). For example, if unemployment increased from the reference to the current period, we would expect the number of marine-related jobs to decrease by a comparable proportion, without causing a lower score for the goal. Therefore, the objective of the goal is actually no loss of jobs and jobs must keep pace with growth in employment rates or sustain losses no greater than national increases in unemployment rates. The current and reference years used for unemployment data were based on the average current year and average reference year across the sector data sources used for number of jobs.\n\n\nTrend\nTrend was calculated as the slope in the individual sector values (not summed sectors) for jobs and wages over the most recent five years (as opposed to the status, which examines changes between two points in time, current versus five years prior to current), corrected by national trends in employment rates and average wages. We then calculated the average trend for jobs across all sectors, with the average weighted by the number of jobs in each sector. We calculated the average trend for wages across all sectors. We then averaged the wages and jobs average slopes to get the livelihoods trend.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nSectors in each region (le_sector_weight): Proportion of jobs within each marine sector\nLivelihood status scores (liv_status): Calculated using adjusted job and wage data in several marine sectors (data not updated since 2013)\nLivelihood trend scores (liv_trend): Calculated using change in adjusted job and wage data in several marine sectors (data not updated since 2013)\nPressure\nSea level rise (cc_slr): Pressure due to rising mean sea level\nHigh bycatch due to artisanal fishing (fp_art_hb): Pressure due to artisanal high bycatch fishing identified by discard tonnes and standardized by NPP\nLow bycatch due to artisanal fishing (fp_art_lb): Pressure due to artisanal low bycatch fishing identified by reported and IUU tonnes and standardized by NPP\nHigh bycatch due to commercial fishing (fp_com_hb): Pressure due to industrial high bycatch fishing identified by discard tonnes and standardized by NPP\nLow bycatch due to commercial fishing (fp_com_lb): Pressure due to industrial low bycatch fishing identified by reported and IUU tonnes and standardized by NPP\nIntertidal habitat destruction (hd_intertidal): Coastal population density (25 mi from shore) as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction\nSubtidal hardbottom habitat destruction (hd_subtidal_hb): Presence of blast fishing as an estimate of subtidal hard bottom habitat destruction\nSubtidal soft bottom habitat destruction (hd_subtidal_sb): Pressure on soft-bottom habitats due to demersal destructive commercial fishing practices (e.g., trawling)\nChemical pollution (po_chemicals): Modeled chemical pollution within EEZ from commercial shipping traffic, ports and harbors, land-based pesticide use (organic pollution), and urban runoff (inorganic pollution)\nNutrient pollution (po_nutrients): Modeled nutrient pollution within EEZ based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nCoastal nutrient pollution (po_nutrients_3nm): Modeled nutrient pollution within 3nm based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nPathogen pollution (po_pathogens): Percent of population without access to improved sanitation facilities as a proxy for pathogen pollution\nMarine plastics (po_trash): Global marine plastic pollution\nNonindigenous species (sp_alien): Measure of harmful invasive species\nGenetic escapes (sp_genetic): Introduced mariculture species (Mariculture Sustainability Index) as a proxy for genetic escapes\nWeakness of social progress (ss_spi): Inverse of Social Progress Index scores\nWeakness of governance (ss_wgi): Inverse of World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\nResilience\nGlobal Competitiveness Index (GCI) (li_gci): Competitiveness in achieving sustained economic prosperity\nEconomic diversity (li_sector_evenness): Sector evenness based on Shannon’s Diversity Index calculated on the proportion of jobs in each sector as a measure of economic diversity\nSocial Progress Index (res_spi): Social Progress Index scores\nStrength of governance (wgi_all): World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores",

    "text": "Natural products\nIn many countries the harvest of non-food natural products is important for local economies and can also be traded internationally. The sustainable harvest of these products is therefore an important component of a healthy ocean. This goal assesses the ability of countries to maximize the sustainable harvest of living marine resources, and includes three natural product categories: ornamental fish, fish oil and fish meal, and inedible seaweeds and marine plants (Table 6.12). It does not include bioprospecting, which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not sustainable. It also excludes wood from mangroves as few data exist for if/where this harvest is happening and whether it is sustainable, as well as oils from mammals as this harvest is widely seen as unsustainable. In past assessments we included coral harvest, shells, and sponges, but we now exclude these resources. In the case of coral, harvest is not sustainable given current and future global threats. For sponges and shells, harvest yields were often highly variable and had relatively small values (Table 6.11), resulting in scores fluctuating dramatically across years for some countries even though the total USD values contributed very little to national economies (e.g. going from 100USD to 200USD would double the score).\nTable 6.11. Commodity values Total value (in USD) of 5 different natural product categories for the entire span of FAO commodities dataset (1976-2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity\nTotal value (USD)\n\n\n\n\nfish_oil\n29801732\n\n\nseaweeds\n15655200\n\n\nornamentals\n4476725\n\n\ncorals\n2798557\n\n\nshells\n1664880\n\n\nsponges\n473272\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, we focus on three natural product categories: ornamental fish, fish oil and fish meal, and inedible seaweeds and marine plants (Table 6.12).\n\nCurrent status\nTo determine the total production in tonnes for seaweed we summed seaweed production provided in the FAO global aquaculture production data (United Nations 2025). To determine total production in tonnes of ornamental fish we summed the products provided in the FAO commodities data (UN-FAO 2025). Finally, to determine the total production in tonnes for fish oil and fish meal, we used Sea Around Us Project (2020) global marine fisheries catch data (D. Pauly, Zeller, and Palomareas 2020) and B/Bmsy data (Ricard et al. 2012; C. Costello et al. 2012; Martell and Froese 2013; Thorson et al. 2013; Rosenberg et al. 2014; Christopher Costello et al. 2016) calculated from our fisheries sub-goal (methods can be found in section 6.6.1), and subsetted the stocks for stocks used for fish oil production (Table 6.12) (Froehlich 2018). The tonnes of harvest of fish oil and fish meal species were multiplied by 0.9 to reflect the amount of the fish actually going to production of feed or oil, while the other 10% of fish is used in other ways, such as direct human consumption (Froehlich 2018).\nTable 6.12.

}_{ c } , (Eq. 6.15)\n\\] where, \\(H_{c}\\) is the harvest level for a category relative to its own peak reference point and \\(S_{c}\\) is the sustainability of that commodity.\nFor seaweeds and ornamental fish we calculated \\(H_{c}\\) as the most recent harvest (in metric tons) per region relative to the maximum harvest ever achieved in that region, under the assumption that the maximum achieved at any point in time was likely the maximum possible. This creates a reference point internal to each country. We rescaled these values from 0-1, with the peak harvest set to 1.0.\nFor fish oil and fish meal, we used the same methods to calculate the status as our fisheries sub-goal, only we subsetted the species (Table 6.12) to those species that contribute to fish oil and fish meal (methods for our fisheries sub-goal can be found in section 6.6.1). The tonnes of harvest of fish oil and fish meal species were multiplied by 0.9 to reflect the proportion of catch among these taxa going to production of feed or oil.\nAlthough we do not know actual sustainable levels of harvest for ornamentals, \\(S_{p}\\), in each region, we estimated it based on exposure and risk components:\n\\[\nS_{c} = 1- average({ E_c+R_c }),  (Eq. 6.16)\n\\]\nwhere \\({E_c}\\) is the exposure term and \\({R_c}\\) is the risk term for ornamentals.\nThe exposure term, \\(E_c\\), is the intensity of harvest for ornamental fish calculated as tonnes of harvest per km2 of coral and rocky reef. This value is scaled by the global 95th quantile of the previous 10 years. We scale the harvest because the distribution of values is highly skewed; thus, because we do not know the true threshold of sustainable harvest, nearly all values would be considered highly sustainable otherwise. To estimate rocky reef extent area (km2) we used data from Halpern et al. (2008) (Halpern et al. 2008), which assumes rocky reef habitat exists in all cells within 1 km of shore. Coral extent area (km2) are from UNEP-WCMC et al. (2018) (UNEP-WCMC et al. 2018).\nThe risk term, \\(R_c\\), is based on whether ornamental fishing has unsustainable harvest practices. In specific, we used the intensity of cyanide and dynamite fishing as a proxy. Risk for ornamental fish was set based on assessments of cyanide or dynamite fishing by Reefs at Risk Revisited under the assumption that most ornamental fishes are harvested from coral reefs.\nFor seaweed commodity sustainability, we used the mariculture sustainability scores represented in the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch aquaculture recommendations (Monterey Bay Aquarium 2025). Ten mariculture practice criteria from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (data quality, effluent, habitat risk, chemical use, feed, escapes, disease, source of stock, predator and wildlife mortalities, and escape of secondary species). These criteria represent the internal mariculture practices with the potential to affect the long term sustainability of the mariculture system. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw SFW score of 10 and minimum of 1. The sustainability score for seaweeds in the Seafood Watch recommendations was a global score, 0.79, which was applied to the seaweed harvest. Seaweed is widely regarded as a very sustainable aquaculture harvest, however, it does poorly on 3 of the 10 criteria that Seafood Watch uses, bringing its average down to 0.79. In specific, it scores poorly on the data quality (having robust and up-to-date information on production practices and their impacts available for analysis), escapes (preventing population-level impacts to wild species or other ecosystem-level impacts from farm escapes), and habitat (maintaining the functionality of ecological valuable habitat) criteria.\nThe fish oil commodity sustainability was estimated using the B/Bmsy values which were calculated in our fisheries sub-goal (section 6.6.1).\nTo estimate the status score, \\(x_{np}\\), for each region and year we took the weighted average of the individual product scores, \\(P_c\\), such that:\n\\[\nx_{np} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ c=1 }^{ N }{ { P }_{ c }\\ast { w }_{ c } }  }{ { { N } }  }, (Eq. 6.17)\n\\]\nwhere \\({N}\\) is the number of product categories, \\(c\\), that were harvested, and \\(w_{c}\\) is the relative contribution of each product to the overall status of the goal. \\(w_c\\) was calculated as the ratio of the 5-year average maximum US dollar value for a product (from the smoothed, gap-filled FAO commodities data) across all years of data for the product, relative to the 5-year average sum of maximum values for all products harvested in the country.\nIf a product had a peak value, but was missing a harvest value for that product in a given year, we used \\(w_{c} = 0\\) during the aggregation for that year.\nBecause dollar values were not present in the data that was used for seaweeds and fish oil, we relied on the FAO global commodities dataset to obtain these, which we used to calculate \\(w_c\\) for each category (Table 6.13).\nTable 6.13.

First, our approach for ornamentals is supply (export) based. If declining demand for ornamentals causes a decline in production, the producing country’s score declines even if it could (sustainably) produce more. Similarly, if a country chose to reduce or halt production of ornamentals in order to improve conservation or sustainability, its score would decline. Second, we do not have Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) estimates for seaweeds or ornamental fish production. When such estimates become available in the future they can easily be incorporated. These scenarios may lead to decreases in the score for a region despite maintenance or even improvement of the sustainable harvest of natural products. Finally, our estimate of the sustainability of the harvest practices of ornamental fish are likely overly optimistic. For example, fishing for ornamental trade often employs unsustainable techniques such as cyanide fishing, but we have few data to inform such an estimate of sustainability in the status calculation for ornamental fish.\nThis model requires both harvest tonnes and value data. However, because of inconsistencies with how data are reported to FAO, there are many cases where harvest data but no value data are reported, and vice versa. We gapfilled these data because otherwise these mismatches in reporting would result in losing real data, especially for producing the weight contributions of each natural product commodity. We used a linear regression model to estimate missing tonnes or US dollar values (Frazier, Longo, and Halpern 2016). For countries that never harvested a product, we assumed they cannot produce it and treat that as a ‘no data’ rather than a zero value. For countries that harvested a product at any point in time, empty values are treated as zeros since the country has the capacity to harvest that product.\n\n\nTrend\nTrend was calculated as described in section 5.3.1.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nHabitat extent of rocky reef (hab_rockyreef_extent): Area of rocky reef habitat\nSeaweed mariculture sustainability score (np_seaweed_sust): Seaweed mariculture sustainability based on the Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI)\nFish oil and fish meal score (np_fofm_scores): Score based on the amount of sustainably and unsustainably caught forage fish used for fish oil and fish meal.

    "section": "Sense of Place",
    "text": "Sense of Place\nThis goal attempts to capture the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. This goal is calculated using two equally weighted subgoals: iconic species and lasting special places.\n\nIconic species (subgoal of sense of place)\nIconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through their relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Ultimately, almost any species can be iconic to someone, and so the intent with this goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than a livelihoods or extractive reason). Habitat-forming species were not included, nor were species harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual).\n\nCurrent status\nThe status of this sub-goal, \\(x_{ico}\\), is the average of status scores of the iconic species in each region based on their IUCN Red List threat categories (IUCN 2024):\n\\[\nx_{ico} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum_{ i=EX }^{ LC }{ S_{i}\\times w_{i} }  }{ \\displaystyle\\sum_{ i=EX }^{ LC }{ S_{i} }  }, (Eq. 6.18)\n\\]\nwhere for each IUCN threat category \\(i\\), \\(S_{i}\\) is the number of assessed species and \\(w_{i}\\) is the status (Table 6.3) following the methods described by Butchart et al. (2007). This formulation gives partial credit to species that still exist but are in one of the other threat categories. The reference point is to have the risk status of all assessed species as Least Concern (i.e., a goal score = 1.0). Species that have not been assessed or labeled as data deficient are not included in the calculation.\nThe list of iconic species was drawn from several data sources (Table 7.5. Iconic species resources), but primarily from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species (especially important to people for their health, livelihoods, and/or culture) and Flagship Species (‘charismatic’ and/or well-known). Many lists exist for globally important, threatened, endemic, etc. species, but in all cases it is not clear if or to what extent these species represent culturally iconic species. The World Wildlife Fund is the only data source that included cultural reasons for listing iconic species. Although, iconic species vary largely among regions, we include little regional information in our list (i.e., the same list is applied to nearly all regions). Additional culturally important species species, available at the continent level (Reyes-García et al. 2023), were added to supplement the original iconic species list.\n\n\nTrend\nWe calculate trend using data the IUCN provides for current and past assessments of species, which we use to create a time series of average risk status for species within each region. Because IUCN assessments are generally infrequent for any given species, we derive the trend as the annual change in risk status for each species across the previous twenty years, rather than a five-year window typical of other goals, and include only taxa with two or more IUCN assessments within the past 20 years.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nIUCN extinction risk (ico_spp_iucn_status): IUCN extinction risk category for iconic species located within each region\nPressure\nOcean acidification (cc_acid): Pressure due to increasing ocean acidification, scaled using biological thresholds\nSea surface temperature (cc_sst): Presure due to increasing extreme sea surface temperature events\nHigh bycatch due to artisanal fishing (fp_art_hb): Pressure due to artisanal high bycatch fishing identified by discard tonnes and standardized by NPP\nHigh bycatch due to commercial fishing (fp_com_hb): Pressure due to industrial high bycatch fishing identified by discard tonnes and standardized by NPP\nTargeted harvest of cetaceans and marine turtles (fp_targetharvest): Targeted harvest of cetaceans and marine turtles\nIntertidal habitat destruction (hd_intertidal): Coastal population density (25 mi from shore) as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction\nSubtidal hardbottom habitat destruction (hd_subtidal_hb): Presence of blast fishing as an estimate of subtidal hard bottom habitat destruction\nCoastal chemical pollution (po_chemicals_3nm): Modeled chemical pollution within 3nm of coastline from commercial shipping traffic, ports and harbors, land-based pesticide use (organic pollution), and urban runoff (inorganic pollution)\nCoastal nutrient pollution (po_nutrients_3nm): Modeled nutrient pollution within 3nm based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nMarine plastics (po_trash): Global marine plastic pollution\nNonindigenous species (sp_alien): Measure of harmful invasive species\nWeakness of social progress (ss_spi): Inverse of Social Progress Index scores\nWeakness of governance (ss_wgi): Inverse of World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\nResilience\nManagement of habitat to protect fisheries biodiversity (fp_habitat): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: habitat related questions\nMinderoo Global Fishing Index (fp_fish_management): Country scale fisheries governance capacity based on policy and objectives, management capacity, information availability and monitoring, level and control of access to fisheries resources, compliance management system, and stakeholder engagement and participation\nArtisanal fisheries management effectiveness (fp_artisanal): Quality of management of small-scale fishing for artisanal and recreational purposes\nEEZ protected marine areas (fishing preservation) (fp_mpa_eez): Protected marine areas within EEZ (lasting special places calculation applied to the entire EEZ)\nCITES signatories (g_cites): Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) signatories\nManagement of habitat to protect habitat biodiversity (hd_habitat): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: habitat related questions\nEEZ protected marine areas (habitat preservation) (hd_mpa_eez): Protected marine areas within EEZ (lasting special places calculation applied to the entire EEZ)\nManagement of waters to preserve biodiversity (po_water): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: clean water management related questions\nSocial Progress Index (res_spi): Social Progress Index scores\nMeasure of ecological integrity (species_diversity_eez): Marine species condition (species subgoal status score) as a proxy for ecological integrity\nStrength of governance (wgi_all): World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\n\n\n\nLasting special places (subgoal of sense of place)\nThe lasting special places sub-goal focuses on geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons (TRC 2004). This sub-goal is particularly hard to quantify. Ideally one would survey every community around the world to determine the top list of special places, and then assess how those locations are faring relative to a desired state (e.g., protected or well managed). The reality is that such lists do not exist. Instead, we assume areas that are protected indicate special places (i.e., the effort to protect them suggests they are important places). Clearly this is an imperfect assumption but in many cases it will be true.\nThe identification of protected areas does not indicate the proportion of special places in a region that are protected. To solve this problem we make two important assumptions. First, we assume that all countries have roughly the same percentage of their coastal waters and coastline that qualify as lasting special places. In other words, they all have the same reference target (as a percentage of the total area). Second, we assume that the target reference level is 30% of area protected (Hughes 2003).\n\nCurrent status\nWe calculate the status of this goal as:\n\\[\nx_{lsp} = \\frac { \\left( \\frac{\\%_{CMPA}}{\\%_{Ref_{CMPA}}} + \\frac {\\%_{CP}}{\\%_{Ref_{CP}}} \\right) }{ 2 }, (Eq. 6.19)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\%_{CMPA}\\) is the proportion of coastal marine protected area, \\(\\%_{CP}\\) is the proportion of coastline protected, and \\(\\%_{Ref} = 30%\\) for both measures.\nWe focus only on coastal waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) for marine special places because we assume lasting special places are primarily in coastal areas. For coastlines, we focus only on the first 1-km-wide strip of land as a way to increase the likelihood that the area being protected by terrestrial parks is connected to the marine system in some way.\nWe use the United Nation’s World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) to identify protected areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2025). The WDPA aggregates several key databases: IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas, Global Marine Protected Areas, UNESCO World Heritage Marine sites, National Parks and Nature Reserves, and the United Nations List of Protected Places. In most cases the year of designation is listed for each protected area.\n\n\nTrend\nTrend was calculated as described in section 5.3.1.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nInland coastal protected areas (lsp_prot_area_inland1km): Protected areas located 1 km inland\nOffshore coastal protected areas (lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm): Protected areas located 3nm offshore\nInland 1km area (rgn_area_inland1km): Inland area of OHI regions within 1km of shoreline\nOffshore 3nm area (rgn_area_offshore3nm): Offshore area of OHI regions within 3nm of shoreline\nPressure\nSea level rise (cc_slr): Pressure due to rising mean sea level\nIntertidal habitat destruction (hd_intertidal): Coastal population density (25 mi from shore) as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction\nSubtidal hardbottom habitat destruction (hd_subtidal_hb): Presence of blast fishing as an estimate of subtidal hard bottom habitat destruction\nCoastal chemical pollution (po_chemicals_3nm): Modeled chemical pollution within 3nm of coastline from commercial shipping traffic, ports and harbors, land-based pesticide use (organic pollution), and urban runoff (inorganic pollution)\nCoastal nutrient pollution (po_nutrients_3nm): Modeled nutrient pollution within 3nm based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nMarine plastics (po_trash): Global marine plastic pollution\nNonindigenous species (sp_alien): Measure of harmful invasive species\nWeakness of social progress (ss_spi): Inverse of Social Progress Index scores\nWeakness of governance (ss_wgi): Inverse of World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\nResilience\nManagement of habitat to protect habitat biodiversity (hd_habitat): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: habitat related questions\nManagement of waters to preserve biodiversity (po_water): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: clean water management related questions\nSocial Progress Index (res_spi): Social Progress Index scores\nStrength of governance (wgi_all): World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores",

    "text": "Tourism and recreation\nThe tourism and recreation goal measures both the quantity and quality of people’s experiences when visiting coastal and marine areas and attractions. While coastal tourism significantly contributes to local economies, we evaluate this goal separately from its economic impact, which we address in the coastal livelihoods and economies goal.\nWe use a combination of international and domestic tourism arrivals data, specifically international overnight visitors, domestic hotel accommodations, and domestic overnight trips. This approach allows us to estimate the total number of people engaging in coastal activities within each region’s coastal area.\nIn addition to capturing the volume of tourism, we incorporate a measure of sustainability to evaluate the long-term viability and impact on coastal regions.\nTo estimate the number of people engaged in sustainable coastal tourism and recreation activities within each region’s coastal area we use international and domestic tourism arrivals (in the form of number of visitor trips including at least one overnight). We also incorporate a metric describing the sustainability of tourism within each country in order to evaluate the long-term viability and impact on coastal regions, and not just the volume of tourism.\n\nCurrent status\nThe model for the status of the tourism & recreation goal, \\(x_{tr}\\), is:\n\\[\nx_{tr} = \\frac{ T_r }{ T_{90th}}, (Eq. 6.20)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(T_{90th}\\) is the \\(T_r\\) value for the region scoring in the 90th quantile, and:\n\\[\nT_{r} = { A }\\times { S }, (Eq. 6.21)\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) is the proportion of coastal arrivals to the coastal area of each OHI region, and \\(S\\) is sustainability.\n\n\nCoastal Arrivals Proportion (A)\nIdeally there would be data describing arrivals specific to coastal regions, \\(A\\); however, the best data available at a global scale reports total international arrivals, which does not solely reflect coastal tourism (general data source, probably not a reference) (UNWTO 2024). Therefore, we estimate coastal tourism based on the proportion of each region’s coastal population, defined as the number of people within 25 km of the ocean, relative to its total population. We then estimate the density of coastal tourism by dividing by coastal area (km2, 1 kilometer inland, and 3 nautical miles out into the eez).\n\\[Ap = \\frac{TourismArrivals * (CoastalPop/TotalPop)}{CoastalArea}\\]\nWhere:\n\nTourismArrivals: Combined international and domestic arrivals\nCoastalPop: Population within 25 miles of the coast\nTotalPop: Total population\nCoastalArea: Area 1 km inland and 3 nautical miles into the EEZ\n\nUnfortunately we could not determine the proportion of international arrivals affiliated with strictly leisure tourism. However, some (unknown) proportion of business travelers also enjoy the coast for leisure during their visit to coastal areas, such that we assumed all tourist arrivals were related to tourism and recreation. Regional applications of the Index can make use of better-resolved data and more direct measures of tourism, as has been done within the US West Coast (Halpern et al. 2014), where data for participation in coastal recreational activities across 19 different sectors were available.\n\n\nSustainability Index (S)\nMeasures of sustainability are data from the World Economic Forum’s Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI). This index measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable and resilient development of the Travel and Tourism (T&T) sector, which in turn contributes to the development of a country.” The index consists of five subindexes, 17 pillars, and 112 individual indicators, distributed among the different pillars. We use scores for the Travel and Tourism Sustainability Subindex which encompasses three pillars:\nPillar 15: Environmental Sustainability\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita\nRenewable energy\nGlobal Climate Risk Index\nInvestment in green energy and infrastructure\nParticulate matter (2.5) concentration\nBaseline water stress\nRed List Index\nForest cover loss\nWastewater treatment\nClean ocean water\nNumber of environmental treaty ratifications\nAdequate protection for nature\nOversight of production impact on the environment and nature\nTotal protected areas coverage\nAverage proportion of key bio\n\nPillar 16: Socioeconomic Resilience and Conditions\n\nPoverty rate\nSocial protection basic coverage\nSocial protection spending\nNot in education, employment or training (NEET) ratio\nEqual workforce opportunities\nWorkers’ rights\nGender Inequality Index\n\nPillar 17: Travel and Tourism Demand Pressure and Impact\n\nT&T GDP multiplier\nInbound length of stay\nSeasonality of international tourist arrivals\nConcentration of interest in cultural attractions\nConcentration of interest in nature attractions\nGeographically dispersed tourism\nQuality of town and city centre\n\nThe sustainability factor, \\(S\\), is the Travel and Tourism Sustainability Subindex score, which is the unweighted average of its three component pillars. Missing sustainability data were gapfilled using per capita GDP (World Bank data with gaps filled using CIA data) based on a linear regression model. For regions without per capita GDP data, remaining missing data were gapfilled using averages of UN geopolitical regions, (Nations 2013b) with sustainability data.\n\n\nTrend\nTrend was calculated as described in section 5.3.1.\n\n\nData\nStatus and trend\nCoastal tourism density (tr_arrivals_props_tourism): Proportion of coastal international and domestic arrivals relative to area of coastline\nTourism sustainability index (tr_sustainability): Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI)\nPressure\nSea level rise (cc_slr): Pressure due to rising mean sea level\nCoastal chemical pollution (po_chemicals_3nm): Modeled chemical pollution within 3nm of coastline from commercial shipping traffic, ports and harbors, land-based pesticide use (organic pollution), and urban runoff (inorganic pollution)\nCoastal nutrient pollution (po_nutrients_3nm): Modeled nutrient pollution within 3nm based on crop fertilizer and manure consumption\nPathogen pollution (po_pathogens): Percent of population without access to improved sanitation facilities as a proxy for pathogen pollution\nMarine plastics (po_trash): Global marine plastic pollution\nWeakness of social progress (ss_spi): Inverse of Social Progress Index scores\nWeakness of governance (ss_wgi): Inverse of World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores\nResilience\nManagement of waters to preserve biodiversity (po_water): Survey responses by country to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report: clean water management related questions\nSocial Progress Index (res_spi): Social Progress Index scores\nStrength of governance (wgi_all): World Governance Indicators (WGI) six combined scores",

    "text": "Goal scores\nEach goal score is the average of its current status and likely future status (Figure 5.1, see section 5: Goal models and data for methods used to calculate status of each goal). The Index assesses the current status of each goal relative to a reference point. Likely future status is estimated using: recent trends in current status; pressures that can stress the system and threaten future delivery of benefits; and resilience to such pressures, due to governance, institutional and ecological factors.\nFigure 5.1. Pie chart describing the contribution of each dimension to the goal score\n\n\n\n\n\nEach goal score, \\(G\\), is the average of its present status, \\(x\\), and its likely near-term future status, \\(\\hat x_{F}\\):\n\\[\nG \\quad =\\quad \\frac {x \\quad +\\quad \\hat x_{F} }{ 2 }, (Eq. 5.3)\n\\]\nThe present status of goal, \\(x\\), is its present state, \\(X\\), relative to a reference point, \\(X_{R}\\), uniquely chosen for each goal:\n\\[\n{ x }_{ i }\\quad =\\quad \\frac { X }{  X_{R} }, (Eq. 5.4)\n\\]\nThe reference point, \\(X_{R}\\), can be determined mechanistically using a production function (e.g., maximum sustainable yield, MSY, for fisheries), spatially by means of comparison with another region (e.g., country X represents the best possible known case), temporally using a past benchmark (e.g., historical habitat extent), or in some cases via known (e.g., zero pollution) or established (e.g., 30% of waters set aside in MPAs) targets. Past benchmarks can either be a fixed point in time or a moving target (e.g., five years prior to most current data). The type of reference point can have important implications for interpretations of how a goal is doing in any given country.\nFor each region, the estimate of a goal’s likely near-term future status is a function of its present status, \\(x\\) modified by: recent trends, \\(T\\), in status; current cumulative pressures, \\(p\\), acting on the goal; and social and ecological resilience, \\(r\\), to pressures given the governance and social institutions in place to protect or regulate the system and the ecological condition of the system:\n\\[\n\\hat {x} _{F} \\quad = \\quad \\left[ 1 \\quad + \\quad \\beta T \\quad + \\quad \\left( 1\\quad -\\quad \\beta  \\right) \\left( r \\quad - \\quad  p \\right)  \\right] x, (Eq. 5.5)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\beta\\) represents the relative importance of the trend versus the resilience and pressure terms in determining the likely trajectory of the goal status into the future. We assume \\(\\beta = 0.67\\), which makes trend twice as important as the pressure/resilience component. We chose this value because we believe the direct measure of trend is a better indicator of future (i.e., in five years) condition than indirect measures of pressure and resilience.\nThe role of the resilience and pressure dimensions is to improve our understanding of the likely near-term future condition by incorporating additional information beyond that provided by the recent trend. Pressure or resilience measures that were in existence in the past may have a cumulative effect that has not yet manifested itself in trend (e.g., fishing pressure may have increasingly negative impacts as successive year classes of fish become increasingly less abundant; resilience due to establishment of a marine protected area (MPA) may require a number of years before its benefits become apparent). In addition, the recent trend does not capture the effect of current levels of resilience and pressures. The expectation of a likely future condition suggested by the trend will become more or less optimistic depending on the resilience and pressure dimensions. If the effects are equal they cancel each other out.\nBoth resilience and pressure dimensions are scaled from 0 to 1, and trend is constrained to -1.0 ≤ \\(T\\) ≤ 1.0 (i.e., values outside this range are clamped to range end values).\nThe likely future status cannot exceed the maximum possible value of the status for each goal, which is 1.0. In reality data are rarely perfect, creating potential situations where likely future condition exceeds 1.0. To address these cases, we implemented two rules. First, if current status = 1.0, then trend is set = 0.0, since any trend &gt; 0.0 in those cases must be due to incomplete or imperfect data. Second, status and likely future status scores were constrained to maximum value of 1.",

    "section": "Likely future status dimensions",
    "text": "Likely future status dimensions\nThree dimensions are used to calculate likely future status: trends, pressure, and resilience. This section describes the calculations underlying these three dimensions.\n\nTrend\nTrend is the proportional change in status predicted to occur in 5 years, based on recent status data. In most cases, this is calculated by estimating the yearly change in status using a linear regression model (i.e., slope estimate) of the five most recent years of status data and multiplying this value by 5 to estimate the change five years into the future. To determine proportional change, we divide the slope estimate by the status value of the earliest year of data used in the trend calculation.\nIn OHI assessments prior to 2016, we calculated trend as the absolute change in status predicted to occur in 5 years. In 2016, we began calculating the proportional change by dividing the slope estimate by the status of the earliest year used in the trend calculation. Although this change rarely had a large effect on trend, or ultimate score values, this method is more consistent with how trend data is incorporated into the likely future status model (Eq. 4.5). If the \\(\\beta\\), pressure (\\(p\\)), and resilience (\\(r\\)) components of the likely future status model are ignored (this assumes the pressure and resilience components fully cancel each other out), the equation becomes:\n\\(x(1 + trend)\\),\nwhere, \\(x\\) is the current status. Given this, if \\(x=50\\), and we expect trend to increase by 10% over 5 years, then likely future status would be: \\(50(1 + 0.10) = 55\\).\nTrends indicate proportional change in status, so they typically range from -100% to +100% (or, -1.0 to +1.0), therefore we constrained values to this range.\nFor all goals we included the trend estimate, even if the linear model was not statistically significant (i.e., P&lt;0.05). We chose to include these values for two key reasons: 1) we were not trying to predict the future but instead only indicate likely condition. 2) in nearly all cases we did not have sufficient data to conduct more rigorous trend analyses.\nIn some cases, we were not able to estimate trend using status data due to data limitations. In these cases, we used alternative methods to estimate trend. Specific details about trend calculations for each goal are provided in section 5.\nWe recognize several possible shortcomings in using past trends to estimate likely future status. We assume a simple linear trend, but this is not always the case due to a variety of variables such as altered pressures and resilience responses, nonlinear patterns in system response, stochastic environmental and biological variability, and simple bounding conditions (status cannot go below zero or above 1.0, and so the trend must level off as it approaches these values). Also, it is important to note that the same trend value could reflect many different processes. For example, declines due to unsustainable harvest of a resource can look identical to declines due to restrictions placed on resource users to allow the resource to recover. It also may be too short a time frame to determine true trends or the causes of those trends, but the intent here is more about informing the likely near-term trajectory.\n\n\nPressure\nThe pressure score, \\(p\\), describes the cumulative pressures acting on a goal which suppress the goal score. Pressure scores range from 0 to 1, and they are calculated for each goal and region and include both ecological (\\(p_{E}\\)) and social pressures (\\(p_{S}\\)) (Table 5.1, Figure 5.2), such that:\n\\[\n{ p }\\quad =\\quad \\gamma *{ p }_{ E }\\quad +\\quad (1-\\gamma )*{ p }_{ S }, (Eq. 5.6)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the relative weight for ecological vs. social pressures and equals 0.5 for the global assessment. At global scales, little evidence exists to support unequal weighting of ecological and social pressures for most goals; furthermore, unequal weighting would require unique values for each goal and there is currently no empirical work to guide such decisions. At local or regional scales there may be clear evidence for unequal weights per goal and \\(\\gamma\\) should be adjusted accordingly.\nFigure 5.2. Pressure components Pressure is calculated using both social and ecological pressures. Ecological pressures include 5 subcategories (fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change, water pollution, and species/genetic introductions).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1.

The intensity of each stressor within each OHI region is scaled from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating the highest stress (e.g., example of one of these data layers is sea surface temperature).\nWe determined the rank sensitivity of each goal/subgoal to each stressor (or, when possible, an element of the goal, such as a specific habitat). We ranked ecological pressures as having ‘high’ (score = 3), ‘medium’ (score = 2), ‘low’ (score = 1), or ‘no’ (score = NA) impact (Table 5.2). Wherever possible we relied on peer-reviewed literature to establish these rankings, and relied on our collective expert judgment in cases with no available literature (Table S28 in Halpern et al. 2012). The pressure ranks are based on a rough estimate of the global average intensity and frequency of the stressor. We recognize that this will create over- and under-estimates for different places around the planet, but to address such variance in a meaningful way would require a separate weighting matrix for every single region on the planet, which is not feasible at this time.\nTable 5.2. Pressure matrix Rank sensitivity of each goal (or, goal element) to each stressor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate the cumulative effect of the ecological pressures, \\(P_E\\), we first determined the cumulative pressure, \\(p\\), within each ecological category, \\(i\\) (e.g., pollution, fishing, etc.):\n\\[\n{ p }_{ i }\\quad =\\quad \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }{ s }_{ i } }  }{ 3 }, (Eq. 5.7)\n\\]\nWhere \\(w_i\\) is the sensitivity ranks (Table 5.2) describing the relative sensitivity of each goal to each stressor, and \\(s_i\\) is intensity of the stressor in each region on a scale of 0-1. We divided by the maximum weighted intensity that could be achieved by the worst stressor (max = 3.0).\nIf \\(p_i\\) &gt; 1.0, we set the value equal to 1.0. This formulation assumes that any cumulative pressure load greater than the maximum intensity of the worst stressor is equivalent to maximum stressor intensity.\nFor the goals for which sensitivity ranks were assigned for specific habitats or livelihood sectors (i.e., goal elements), we calculated the weighted sum of the pressures for only those habitats or sectors that were present in the country.\nThe overall ecological pressure, \\(p_E\\), acting on each goal and region was calculated as the weighted-average of the pressure scores, \\(p\\), for each category, \\(i\\), with weights set as the maximum rank in each pressure category (\\(w_{i\\_max}\\)) for each goal, such that:\n\\[\n{ p }_{ E }\\quad =\\quad \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { (w }_{ i\\_ max }*{ p }_{ i }) }  }{ \\displaystyle\\sum_{ i=1 }^{ N } { { w }_{ i\\_ max } }  },  (Eq. 5.8)\n\\]\nStressors that have no impact drop out rather than being assigned a rank of zero, which would affect the average score.\n\n\nSocial pressures\nSocial pressures describe the lack of effectiveness of government and social institutions. Social stressors are described for each region on a scale of 0 to 1 (with one indicating the highest pressure). Social pressure is then calculated as the average of the social stressors:\n\\[\n{ p }_{ S }\\quad =\\quad \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ z_{ i } }  }{ N }, (Eq. 5.9)\n\\]\nwhere \\(z_{i}\\) are the social pressure measures specific to the goal. Unequal weighting may be appropriate in some cases but is difficult to assess currently, particularly at the global scale.\n\n\nCaveats\nThere were a number of ecological pressures not included in our assessment, including altered sediment regimes, noise and light pollution, toxic chemicals from point sources, nutrient pollution from atmospheric deposition and land-based sources other than fertilizer application to agricultural land. In all cases, global data do not exist in a format that would allow for adequate comparisons within and among countries. Future global or regional iterations of the Index could include these data as they become available.\nThe calculation of ecological pressures is sensitive to the number of stressors within each category (but not to the number of categories). Inclusion of additional stressors within categories would require careful calibration of ranks so that the cumulative effect of a larger number of stressors does not overestimate pressure.\nA key assumption in our assessment of ecological pressures is that each goal has a linear and additive response to increases in intensity of the stressors. Clearly many ecosystems respond non-linearly to increased stressor intensity, exhibiting threshold responses, and there are likely nonlinear interactions among stressors. Unfortunately little is known about the nature of these types of nonlinearities and interactions so we could not include them in any meaningful way.\n\n\n\nResilience\nTo calculate resilience for each goal and region, \\(r\\), we assess three resilience categories (Table 5.3, Figure 5.3): ecological integrity, \\(Y_{E}\\), regulatory efforts that address ecological pressures, \\(Y_R\\), and social integrity, \\(Y_{S}\\). The first two measures address ecological resilience while the third addresses social resilience. When all three aspects are relevant to a goal, resilience is calculated as:\n\\[\nr\\quad =\\quad \\gamma *(\\frac { { Y }_{ E }+ {Y}_{R} }{ 2 } )+(1-\\gamma )*{ Y }_{ S }, (Eq. 5.10)\n\\]\nWe chose \\(\\gamma = 0.5\\) so the weight of resilience components that address ecological systems (ecosystem and regulatory) vs. social systems would be equivalent to the proportions used in the model to calculate pressure. Resilience indicators are intended to directly address, as much as possible, specific pressures. Consequently, within a pressure category, resilience scores should not exceed pressure scores, otherwise likely future status scores will be inflated. For the 2021 OHI assessment, in a significant modification from past OHI methods (Halpern et al. 2012), where total resilience scores were allowed to exceed total pressures scores, we have capped resilience such that it will not exceed the corresponding pressures, e.g., \\((r−p) ≤ 0\\) (i.e. \\(r≤p\\)), when calculating the likely future status for a given goal (O’Hara et al. 2020).\nFigure 5.3. Resilience components Resilience includes both ecological and social resilience categories. Ecological resilience includes an ecosystem and regulatory category. The regulatory category includes 5 subcategories that mirror the pressure categories (fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change, water pollution, and species/genetic introductions) as well as a goal-specific category.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach resilience category is composed of 1 or more data layers (Table 5.3) with values scaled from 0-1, reflecting the magnitude of resilience, for each region (an example of one of these data layers describes tourism regulations that preserve biodiversity). Each resilience data layer is assigned a weight of 0.5 or 1 (Table 5.3) that is applied equally across all the goals (or, goal elements) influenced by the resilience layer (i.e., resilience matrix, Table 5.4). This information is used to calculate a score for each resilience category. The weight reflects information about governance.\nTable 5.3. Resilience categories and weights The data layers used to calculate resilience for each goal and region for the global assessment (descriptions of data layers and sources are in section 6). Each data layer is assigned to an ecological or social category. The ecological category is broken into an ecosystem and regulatory category type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3.

Resilience matrix Describes which goals/subgoals (and goal elements) are influenced by the resilience data layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcological resilience \n\nEcosystem integrity\nEcosystem integrity, e.g., food web integrity, is measured as relative condition of assessed species in a given location (scores from the species subgoal were used to estimate ecosystem integrity). For some goals, there is little evidence that our index of ecosystem integrity directly affects the value of the goal (or subgoal). In these instances, ecological integrity falls out of the resilience model.\nFor the global assessments, we only have one data layer describing ecosystem integrity, however, if there were multiple layers the overall score for ecosystem integrity would be a weighted mean of all the data layers, \\(i\\), that describe ecosystem integrity (\\(y_{E,i}\\)) and influence the goal:\n\\[\n{ Y }_{ E }\\quad =\\quad \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }{ y_E}_{i} }  }{ \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }}}, (Eq. 5.11)\n\\]\n\n\nRegulatory resilience\nRegulatory resilience (\\(Y_R\\)) describes the institutional measures (e.g., rules, regulations, and laws) designed to address ecological pressures. The regulatory resilience datasets are grouped into five categories that address the 5 pressure categories: fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change (including ocean acidification), water pollution, and species introductions (invasive species and genetic escapes). There is also an additional category for goal-specific regulations that apply to a goal or goals, but do not address a larger pressure category.\nWeights were based effectiveness of governance. Governance is a function of 1) institutional structures that address the intended objective, 2) a clear process for implementing the institution is in place, and 3) whether the institution has been effective at meeting stated objectives. At global scales it is very difficult to assess these three elements; we usually only had information on whether institutions exist. However, in some cases we had detailed information on institutions that enabled us to assess whether they would contribute to effective management, and thus, increased ocean health. In those latter cases, we gave more weight to those measures (Table 5.3).\nFor each region and goal, we calculated a score for each regulatory category, \\(y_{R, i}\\), as a weighted mean of the resilience data layers, \\(r_{i}\\), that influence the goal (Table 5.4):\n\\[\ny_{R, i}\\quad =\\quad \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }{ r }_{ i } }  }{ \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{w_i} }, (Eq. 5.12)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(w_i\\) is the weight in Table 5.3.\nTo calculate the overall regulatory resilience, \\(Y_{R}\\), we averaged the scores for each regulatory category.\n\n\n\nSocial integrity resilience\nSocial integrity is intended to describe those processes internal to a community that affect its resilience. It is a function of a wide range of aspects of social structure. Social Integrity per goal for each region, \\(Y_{S}\\), is therefore:\n\\[\nY_{ S}\\quad =\\quad \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { y }_{ S,i } }  }{ N }, (Eq. 5.13)\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_{S,i}\\) are the social integrity measures specific to the goal.\nIdeally, assessments of social resilience would include state and federal level rules and other relevant institutional mechanisms as well. However, such information is extremely difficult to access for every single country, and so we relied on global datasets that focus on international treaties and assessments. Another key gap is information on social norms and community (and other local-scale) institutions (such as tenure or use rights) that influence resource use and management in many settings. Information on these institutions is also extremely difficult to find at a global scale, although the World Governance Indicator (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2010) partly measures their effectiveness through its inclusion of corruption indices.",

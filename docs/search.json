    "text": "We define ocean health as the sustainable delivery of ten widely-held public goals for ocean ecosystems (Table 2.1). These goals represent the full suite of benefits that people want and need from the ocean, including the traditional ‘goods and services’ people often consider (e.g., fish to eat, coastal protection from nearshore habitats) as well as benefits less commonly accounted for, such as cultural values and biodiversity. Within each region, scores, ranging from 0 to 100, are calculated for the 10 goals (section 5.2). Four of the goals are calculated from 2 subgoals. The subgoals are calculated independently (i.e., they are treated as if they are goals) and then combined into the goal status score (Table 2.2).\n\n\nTable 2.1.

For direct comparisons among locations to be valid, they must use consistent data. For this reason, we focused on using global datasets so differences in Index scores across regions are driven by differences in ocean health rather than variation in the data. Although, in reality, many global datasets are compilations of local or regional datasets and their quality varies spatially. In some cases, data for a particular component or dimension of a goal were available for most, but not all, countries. Gaps in these data were known to not be true zero values. Rather than exclude these data layers, we employed several different methods to fill these data gaps [@frazier2016mapping].\nThese guidelines both motivated and constrained our methods. The development of the model frameworks for each goal (including reference points) was heavily dictated by the availability of global datasets. And, ultimately, several key elements related to ocean health could not be included due to lack of existing or appropriate global datasets. As new and better data become available in the future, details of how goals or dimensions are modeled will likely change, although the framework we have developed can accommodate these changes.\nFor Index scores to be comparable, every region must have a value for each data layer included in the analysis, unless it is known to not be relevant to a region. In other words, missing data are not acceptable [@burgass2017navigating]. Adhering to this criterion is critical to avoid influencing the Index score simply because of inclusion (or absence) of a particular data layer for any reporting region.\nGaps in data are common; many developing countries lack the resources to gather detailed datasets, and even developed, data-rich countries have inevitable data gaps. We use a variety of methods to estimate missing data, including: averages of closely related groups (e.g., regions sharing ecological, spatial, political attributes; taxonomic groups; etc.), spatial or temporal interpolation (e.g., raster or time-series data), and predictive models (e.g., regression analysis, machine learning, etc.). Gapfilling is a major source of uncertainty, especially for certain goals and regions. Given how common gaps in data are, clear documentation of gapfilling is a critical step of index development because it provides a measure of the reliability of index scores.\nOne of the ongoing goals of the Ocean Health Index (OHI) has been to improve our approach to dealing with missing data, by quantifying the potential influence of gapfilled data on index scores, and developing effective methods of tracking, quantifying, and communicating this information [@frazier2016mapping]."

The Index assesses the current status of each goal relative to a reference point. Likely future status is estimated using: recent trends in current status; pressures that can stress the system and threaten future delivery of benefits; and resilience to such pressures, due to governance, institutional and ecological factors.\nFigure 5.1. Pie chart describing the contribution of each dimension to the goal score\n\n\n\n\n\nEach goal score, \\(G\\), is the average of its present status, \\(x\\), and its likely near-term future status, \\(\\hat x_{F}\\):\n\\[\nG \\quad =\\quad \\frac {x \\quad +\\quad \\hat x_{F} }{ 2 }, (Eq. 5.3)\n\\]\nThe present status of goal, \\(x\\), is its present state, \\(X\\), relative to a reference point, \\(X_{R}\\), uniquely chosen for each goal:\n\\[\n{ x }_{ i }\\quad =\\quad \\frac { X }{  X_{R} }, (Eq. 5.4)\n\\]\nThe reference point, \\(X_{R}\\), can be determined mechanistically using a production function (e.g., maximum sustainable yield, MSY, for fisheries), spatially by means of comparison with another region (e.g., country X represents the best possible known case), temporally using a past benchmark (e.g., historical habitat extent), or in some cases via known (e.g., zero pollution) or established (e.g., 30% of waters set aside in MPAs) targets. Past benchmarks can either be a fixed point in time or a moving target (e.g., five years prior to most current data). The type of reference point can have important implications for interpretations of how a goal is doing in any given country.\nFor each region, the estimate of a goal’s likely near-term future status is a function of its present status, \\(x\\) modified by: recent trends, \\(T\\), in status; current cumulative pressures, \\(p\\), acting on the goal; and social and ecological resilience, \\(r\\), to pressures given the governance and social institutions in place to protect or regulate the system and the ecological condition of the system:\n\\[\n\\hat {x} _{F} \\quad = \\quad \\left[ 1 \\quad + \\quad \\beta T \\quad + \\quad \\left( 1\\quad -\\quad \\beta  \\right) \\left( r \\quad - \\quad  p \\right)  \\right] x, (Eq. 5.5)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\beta\\) represents the relative importance of the trend versus the resilience and pressure terms in determining the likely trajectory of the goal status into the future. We assume \\(\\beta = 0.67\\), which makes trend twice as important as the pressure/resilience component. We chose this value because we believe the direct measure of trend is a better indicator of future (i.e., in five years) condition than indirect measures of pressure and resilience.\nThe role of the resilience and pressure dimensions is to improve our understanding of the likely near-term future condition by incorporating additional information beyond that provided by the recent trend. Pressure or resilience measures that were in existence in the past may have a cumulative effect that has not yet manifested itself in trend (e.g., fishing pressure may have increasingly negative impacts as successive year classes of fish become increasingly less abundant; resilience due to establishment of a marine protected area (MPA) may require a number of years before its benefits become apparent). In addition, the recent trend does not capture the effect of current levels of resilience and pressures. The expectation of a likely future condition suggested by the trend will become more or less optimistic depending on the resilience and pressure dimensions. If the effects are equal they cancel each other out.\nBoth resilience and pressure dimensions are scaled from 0 to 1, and trend is constrained to -1.0 ≤ \\(T\\) ≤ 1.0 (i.e., values outside this range are clamped to range end values).\nThe likely future status cannot exceed the maximum possible value of the status for each goal, which is 1.0. In reality data are rarely perfect, creating potential situations where likely future condition exceeds 1.0. To address these cases, we implemented two rules. First, if current status = 1.0, then trend is set = 0.0, since any trend &gt; 0.0 in those cases must be due to incomplete or imperfect data. Second, status and likely future status scores were constrained to maximum value of 1."

    "text": "Likely future status dimensions\nThree dimensions are used to calculate likely future status: trends, pressure, and resilience. This section describes the calculations underlying these three dimensions.\n(previously: r child = ‘../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/trend.Rmd’, eval=trend)\n\nTrend\nTrend is the proportional change in status predicted to occur in 5 years, based on recent status data. In most cases, this is calculated by estimating the yearly change in status using a linear regression model (i.e., slope estimate) of the five most recent years of status data and multiplying this value by 5 to estimate the change five years into the future. To determine proportional change, we divide the slope estimate by the status value of the earliest year of data used in the trend calculation.\nIn OHI assessments prior to 2016, we calculated trend as the absolute change in status predicted to occur in 5 years. In 2016, we began calculating the proportional change by dividing the slope estimate by the status of the earliest year used in the trend calculation. Although this change rarely had a large effect on trend, or ultimate score values, this method is more consistent with how trend data is incorporated into the likely future status model (Eq. 4.5). If the \\(\\beta\\), pressure (\\(p\\)), and resilience (\\(r\\)) components of the likely future status model are ignored (this assumes the pressure and resilience components fully cancel each other out), the equation becomes:\n\\(x(1 + trend)\\),\nwhere, \\(x\\) is the current status. Given this, if \\(x=50\\), and we expect trend to increase by 10% over 5 years, then likely future status would be: \\(50(1 + 0.10) = 55\\).\nTrends indicate proportional change in status, so they typically range from -100% to +100% (or, -1.0 to +1.0), therefore we constrained values to this range.\nFor all goals we included the trend estimate, even if the linear model was not statistically significant (i.e., P&lt;0.05). We chose to include these values for two key reasons: 1) we were not trying to predict the future but instead only indicate likely condition. 2) in nearly all cases we did not have sufficient data to conduct more rigorous trend analyses.\nIn some cases, we were not able to estimate trend using status data due to data limitations. In these cases, we used alternative methods to estimate trend. Specific details about trend calculations for each goal are provided in section 5.\nWe recognize several possible shortcomings in using past trends to estimate likely future status. We assume a simple linear trend, but this is not always the case due to a variety of variables such as altered pressures and resilience responses, nonlinear patterns in system response, stochastic environmental and biological variability, and simple bounding conditions (status cannot go below zero or above 1.0, and so the trend must level off as it approaches these values). Also, it is important to note that the same trend value could reflect many different processes. For example, declines due to unsustainable harvest of a resource can look identical to declines due to restrictions placed on resource users to allow the resource to recover. It also may be too short a time frame to determine true trends or the causes of those trends, but the intent here is more about informing the likely near-term trajectory.\n(r child = ‘../../metadata_documentation/ohi_model/pressure.Rmd’, eval=pressure)\n\n\nPressure\nThe pressure score, \\(p\\), describes the cumulative pressures acting on a goal which suppress the goal score. Pressure scores range from 0 to 1, and they are calculated for each goal and region and include both ecological (\\(p_{E}\\)) and social pressures (\\(p_{S}\\)) (Table 5.1, Figure 5.2), such that:\n\\[\n{ p }\\quad =\\quad \\gamma *{ p }_{ E }\\quad +\\quad (1-\\gamma )*{ p }_{ S }, (Eq. 5.6)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the relative weight for ecological vs. social pressures and equals 0.5 for the global assessment. At global scales, little evidence exists to support unequal weighting of ecological and social pressures for most goals; furthermore, unequal weighting would require unique values for each goal and there is currently no empirical work to guide such decisions. At local or regional scales there may be clear evidence for unequal weights per goal and \\(\\gamma\\) should be adjusted accordingly.\nFigure 5.2. Pressure components Pressure is calculated using both social and ecological pressures. Ecological pressures include 5 subcategories (fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change, water pollution, and species/genetic introductions).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1. Pressure data and categories Description of the stressor data layers used to calculate overall pressure for each goal and region for the global assessment (descriptions of pressure data in section 6).

The five categories are intended to capture known pressures to the social-ecological system associated with each goal. Each pressure category may include several stressors. The intensity of each stressor within each OHI region is scaled from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating the highest stress (e.g., example of one of these data layers is sea surface temperature).\nWe determined the rank sensitivity of each goal/subgoal to each stressor (or, when possible, an element of the goal, such as a specific habitat). We ranked ecological pressures as having ‘high’ (score = 3), ‘medium’ (score = 2), ‘low’ (score = 1), or ‘no’ (score = NA) impact (Table 5.2). Wherever possible we relied on peer-reviewed literature to establish these rankings, and relied on our collective expert judgment in cases with no available literature (Table S28 in Halpern et al. 2012). The pressure ranks are based on a rough estimate of the global average intensity and frequency of the stressor. We recognize that this will create over- and under-estimates for different places around the planet, but to address such variance in a meaningful way would require a separate weighting matrix for every single region on the planet, which is not feasible at this time.\nTable 5.2.
